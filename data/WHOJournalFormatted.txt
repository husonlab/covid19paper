COVID-19 Pandemic, Corona Viruses, and Diabetes Mellitus	Muniyappa, Ranganath; Gubbi, Sriram	The pandemic of COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV-2, is causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Older age and presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity significantly increases the risk for hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients. In this Perspective, informed by the studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS-CoV, and the current literature on SARS-CoV-2, we discuss potential mechanisms by which diabetes modulates the host-viral interactions and host-immune responses. We hope to highlight gaps in knowledge that require further studies pertinent to COVID-19 in patients with diabetes.	2020	NA	American journal of physiology.

Covid-19 infection and mortality - A physiologist's perspective enlightening clinical features and plausible interventional strategies	Abassi, Zaid A.; Skorecki, Karl; Heyman, Samuel Noam; Kinaneh, Safa; Armaly, Zaher	Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to converting enzyme 2 receptors (ACE2) in host cells, as 41 was also reported for its recent preceding epidemic causing viral family member, SARS-CoV-1, 42 responsible for the 2003-2004 outbreak in southeastern China (1). ACE2 is abundant in the 43 lungs, heart, blood vessels, tests, brain and intestine(2, 3), and is responsible for the production 44 of Angiotensin 1-7, which exerts vasodilatory, natriuretic/diuretic, anti-inflammatory and 45 antifibrotic effects via the Mas receptor (2, 4). In the lung, the organ most vulnerable to SARS- 46 CoV-2 infection in the ongoing current pandemic, ACE2 is localized to type II (AT2), and to a 47 lesser extent to type I (AT1) alveolar cells (4). Remarkably, AT2 express many genes that are 48 profoundly involved in the reproduction and transmission of the virus (5). The kidney and testis, 49 two additional organs susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 also express high immunoreactivity to ACE2(2, 50 3), which therefore can be reasonably hypothesized as a candidate for possible involvement in 51 the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, which also encompass acute kidney injury and 52 impaired fertility (6-8) (Fig 1). Furthermore, preliminary available data from infected patients 53 illustrate that patients treated with angiotensin-II inhibitors (ACE-I)/angiotensin receptor 54 blockers (ARBs) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exhibit severe symptoms 55 with a higher mortality rate as compared to non-user counterparts (6-8). Of notable relevance 56 is the demonstration that that ACE-I, ARBS and even mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockers 57 remarkably augment the expression of ACE-2 both in diabetic patients (6, 9) and animals with 58 experimental heart failure (10). Similarly, NSAIDs, non-selectively block cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 59 and COX-2, both enzymes being abundant in kidney tissue and well-established for the role in 60 beneficial vasodilatory and natriuretic responses, as the case with ACE2.	2020	NA	American Journal of Physiology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1152/ajplung.00097.2020	15943	#15431	Abassi 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1152/ajplung.00097.2020	* Corresponding Author; email: [email protected]1Physiology and Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel* Corresponding Author; email: [email protected]                 Search for more papers by this author             |2Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.

Covid-19 risks and response in South Asia	Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.; Basnyat, Buddha; Saha, Samir; Laxminarayan, Ramanan	The region is ill prepared for the crisis that lies ahead Over the past few weeks we have seen political leaders, policy makers, and health managers grapple with the reality of a novel coronavirus outbreak and its potential for global spread.12 From what initially seemed like a localised outbreak in Hubei province of China in December 2019, it rapidly became clear that SARS-CoV-2 had pandemic potential.3 But it was almost two months before the World Health Organization declared a true global pandemic. The number of deaths from covid-19 in Italy now exceeds those reported from China, and the outbreak in Iran may have seeded cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan.4 The number of reported cases in South Asia remains relatively low, however, and the response patchy. By 24 March, authorities in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which comprises India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bhutan, and Afghanistan, had reported just 1536 confirmed cases and â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1190-m1190	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1190	15882	#15299	Bhutta 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1136/bmj.m1190	1Center of Excellence in Women and Child Health, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan |2Oxford University Clinical Research Unit-Patan Academy of Health Sciences, Kathmandu, Nepal|3Child Health Research Foundation, Dhaka, Bangladesh|4Center for Disease Dynamic, Economics and Policy, New Delhi, India	('Pakistan', 1)|('Nepal', 1)|('Bangladesh', 1)|('India', 1)

Covid-19: how a virus is turning the world upside down	Kickbusch, Ilona; Leung, Gabriel M.; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.; Matsoso, Malebona Precious; Ihekweazu, Chikwe; Abbasi, Kamran	We may emerge from this with a healthier respect for our common humanity The covid-19 pandemic is the biggest threat in living memory to health and wellbeing, social welfare, and the global economy. In a world shaped by neoliberalism the economy has always come first, but many leaders of rich countries are now explicitly prioritising peopleâ€™s health over the economy. On 26 March, G20 leaders held an extraordinary summit on health, focusing on covid-19. In the face of the severe economic impact of necessary public health actions, financial rules that were considered sacrosanct are being bent with startling speed and force. Germanyâ€™s chancellor, Angela Merkel, promised, â€œWe will do what is necessary.â€ Germany has enough financial reserves and emergency instruments to release additional funds and maintain economic life.1 France is engaged in an economic and financial war, according to its finance minister: â€œThis war will be long, it will be violent, and we must mobilise all our national, European, and G7 forces.â€2 President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa believes that, â€œWhat we are witnessing is social solidarity in action, a defining feature of our nationhood.â€3 The global economy is braced for at least $2.7tn (Â£2tn; â‚¬2.5tn) in lost output, equivalent to the annual gross domestic product of the United Kingdom.4 Projections indicate that many economies will be crippled and unable to recover quickly, especially in the global South.5 The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, created to implement the Marshall plan after the second world war, is calling for a global new deal.6 If economies and social order collapse in South Asia, Africa, or Latin America, no border, wall, or boundary will be enough to contain the consequences. At its emergency summit, the G20 committed â€œto do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic,â€ â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ (Clinical research ed.)	369	NA	m1336-m1336	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1336	30608	#30594	Kickbusch 2020	NA	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1336	1Global Health Programme, Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva, Switzerland|2Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China|3Centre for Global Child Health, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada|4Wits Health Consortium, University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa|5Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Abuja, Nigeria|6The BMJ, London, UK	('Niger', 2)|('Switzerland', 1)|('China', 1)|('Canada', 1)|('South Africa', 1)|('UK', 1)
Healthcare information for all	Pakenham-Walsh, Neil; Godlee, Fiona	Together, we can stop people dying from a lack of timely accurate healthcare information The World Medical Association (WMA) has unanimously approved a statement on healthcare information for all, proposed by the British Medical Association.1 The statement notes that lack of access to timely, current, evidence based healthcare information continues to be a major contributor to morbidity and mortality, especially in low and middle income countries, and calls on doctors worldwide to support initiatives to improve access for health professionals, patients, and the public. The BMJ hosted a conference on this issue in 19942 and cofounded Hinari in 2001, a partnership between publishers and the World Health Organization to improve the availability of e-journals and e-books in low and middle income countries.3 In 2004 we coauthored a paper in the Lancet describing the global healthcare information system and its interdependent parts.4 We called for a global campaign to support communication, understanding, and advocacy among all stakeholders. These include researchers, journal publishers, systematic reviewers, guideline developers, publishers of secondary materials (from textbooks to radio shows), those who guide and provide access (from search engines to librarians), and all who share the vision of a world where everyone has access to the information they need to protect their own and othersâ€™ health.

Covid-19 exposes weaknesses in European response to outbreaks	Anderson, Michael; McKee, Martin; Mossialos, Elias	European countries must work together in the common interest Covid-19 continues to spread across Europe. Italy, Germany, Spain, and France have all diagnosed over 6000 cases.1 Italy, which has diagnosed over 27â€‰000, the highest number outside China, has implemented nationwide restrictions on movement. On 10 March, the European Council met by video link to discuss the joint European approach to covid-19.2 Four priorities were identified: limiting the spread of the virus, provision of medical equipment, promotion of research, and dealing with the socioeconomic consequences. The importance of strengthening solidarity, cooperation, and exchange of information between member states was also reiterated. Despite high level political commitment from the EU, the ongoing spread of covid-19 exposes important obstacles to developing a comprehensive European response to infectious disease outbreaks. Member states have long guarded their national responsibility for health services.3 There are provisions within European treaties for acting together on public health issues, but they are limited. â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1075-m1075	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1075	9624	#9706	Anderson 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Ethics, social science, economics; Infection prevention and control	10.1136/bmj.m1075	1London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK|2London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK|3Imperial College London, London, UK	('UK', 3)
Covid-19: how doctors and healthcare systems are tackling coronavirus worldwide	Tanne, Janice Hopkins; Hayasaki, Erika; Zastrow, Mark; Pulla, Priyanka; Smith, Paul; Rada, Acer Garcia	As coronavirus continues to spread, doctors and healthcare systems are facing a multitude of challenges at all stages of the pandemic The United States declared a national emergency on 13 March as covid-19 spread to 49 of the countryâ€™s 50 states. President Donald Trump announced $50bn (Â£42.1bn; â‚¬45.6bn) to help combat the virus, as well as powers to waive laws and restrictions to make care more available, such as through telehealth and allowing doctors to practise in states they are not licensed in. The presidentâ€”who has tested negative for covid-19 after contact with an infected Brazilian officialâ€”said that many more test kits would soon be available, as would a website to guide people as to signs of infection and whether they should seek testing. The vice president, Mike Pence, who is in charge of response to the outbreak, said that the focus was on the partnership between the government, private companies, and commercial and public laboratories to make widespread testing available. About 2000 laboratories would soon be able to process the tests, he said. The US government had faced mounting criticism over its response and admitted to failing to provide enough test kits. In the 13 March press conference Trump said that the Food and Drug Administration had approved a new test from the drug manufacturer Roche and that half a million of the kits would be available by 22 March, five million within a month. Deborah Birx, the White House response coordinator for covid-19, said that the tests would provide answers within 24 to 36 hours. The president also said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would open a website (www.coronavirus.gov)1 to help people decide whether they should seek testing. Leaders of commercial testing laboratories, drug store chains, and mass market retailers said that â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1090-m1090	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1090	9623	#9696	Tanne 2020	NA	* Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Ethics, social science, economics; Infection prevention and control	10.1136/bmj.m1090	1New York|2Boston|3Seoul|4Bangalore|5Sydney|6Madrid	NA
Managing mental health challenges faced by healthcare workers during covid-19 pandemic	Greenberg, Neil; Docherty, Mary; Gnanapragasam, Sam; Wessely, Simon	Neil Greenberg and colleagues set out measures that healthcare managers need to put in place to protect the mental health of healthcare staff having to make morally challenging decisions The covid-19 pandemic is likely to put healthcare professionals across the world in an unprecedented situation, having to make impossible decisions and work under extreme pressures. These decisions may include how to allocate scant resources to equally needy patients, how to balance their own physical and mental healthcare needs with those of patients, how to align their desire and duty to patients with those to family and friends, and how to provide care for all severely unwell patients with constrained or inadequate resources. This may cause some to experience moral injury or mental health problems. Moral injury, a term that originated in the military, can be defined as the psychological distress that results from actions, or the lack of them, which violate someoneâ€™s moral or ethical code.1 Unlike formal mental health conditions such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder, moral injury is not a mental illness. But those who develop moral injuries are likely to experience negative thoughts about themselves or others (for example, â€œI am a terrible personâ€ or â€œMy bosses donâ€™t care about peopleâ€™s livesâ€) as well as intense feelings of shame, guilt, or disgust. These symptoms can contribute to the development of mental health difficulties, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and even suicidal ideation.2 Equally, some people who have to contend with significant challenges, moral or traumatic, experience a degree of post-traumatic growth,3 a term used to describe a bolstering of psychological resilience, esteem, outlook, and values after exposure to highly challenging situations. Whether someone develops a psychological injury or experiences psychological growth is likely to be influenced by the way that they are supported â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1211-m1211	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1211	16619	#15931	Greenberg 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1136/bmj.m1211	1NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emergency Preparedness and Response, King’s College London, London, UK|2South London and the Maudsley NHS Trust, London, UK	('UK', 2)
Video consultations for covid-19	Greenhalgh, Trisha; Wherton, Joe; Shaw, Sara; Morrison, Clare	An opportunity in a crisis? The rapid spread of covid-19, and the fact that healthcare facilities could be sources of contagion, has focused attention on new models of care that avoid face-to-face contact between clinician and patient. There has been particular interest in video consultations, which are already being rolled out in many countries as part of national digital health strategies.123 How appropriate are video consultations for dealing with the coronavirus crisisâ€”and what are the challenges of scaling up this model at speed? Randomised trials (most of which were underpowered) have shown that clinical consultations conducted through a video link tend to be associated with high satisfaction among patients and staff; no difference in disease progression; no substantial difference in service use; and lower transaction costs compared with traditional clinic based care.4567 However, almost all this evidence pertains to highly selected samples of hospital outpatients with chronic, stable conditions and is largely irrelevant to the current escalating situation involving patients with an acute and potentially serious illness. Organisational case studies have shown that introducing video consultations is a complex change that disrupts long established processes and routines.891011 Some â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m998-m998	NA	10.1136/bmj.m998	8263	#7708	Greenhalgh 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Infection prevention and control	10.1136/bmj.m998	1Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK|2Technology Enabled Care Programme, Scottish Government, Edinburgh, UK |Correspondence to: T Greenhalgh trish.greenhalgh{at}phc.ox.ac.uk	('UK', 2)|('uk', 1)

Coronavirus shows how UK must act quickly before being shut out of Europeâ€™s health protection systems	Flear, Mark; de Ruijter, Anniek; McKee, Martin	The threat posed by 2019-nCoV and the fragmentation of existing health protection systems caused by Brexit call for urgent assessment of cross Europe cooperation, say Mark Flear, Anniek de Ruijter, and Martin McKeeHealth authorities worldwide are racing to contain the spread of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV, identified as the cause of the outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, at the end of last year. By 31 January more than 9600 people were reported to have been infected in China, with around 200 deaths, and cases have also been reported elsewhere in Asia and in North America, Australia, and Europe, including France, Finland, Germany, and now the UK.1 The case in Germany is especially worrying as it was in someone who had not travelled to China but who had been in contact with someone who had. Unprecedented measures, including lockdowns of large cities in China and widespread flight cancellations, are being adopted.The international response to major outbreaks of infectious disease is coordinated by the World Health Organization and is based on its International Health Regulations.2 Europe also has a regime for communicable disease control,3 centred on the Stockholm based European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which has a crucial role in responding to threats to health in the continent.Given the UKâ€™s departure from the European Union, we argue that the coronavirus outbreak is an urgent warning highlighting the need to reflect on what Brexit might mean for the countryâ€™s health security. We review how that system operates and what the implications might be for the UK. In doing so we draw on the experience of Switzerland.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation after hospital admission with covid-19	Fritz, ZoÃ«; Perkins, Gavin D.	The balance of benefits and risks has changed, and practice must change with it In normal times, the medical obligation to â€œfirst do no harmâ€ applies to the actions of individual doctors on individual patients. During pandemics, the ethical imperatives shift: we must consider the safety of not only the individual patient but also the clinician and the population. Guidelines on attempting cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the acute hospital setting for patients with covid-19 have produced conflict and moral discomfort because of differences of opinion about the balance of benefits and risks to both patients and staff.1 In normal circumstances, the annual incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrests in adults is 1-10 per 1000 admissions.23 Those with non-cardiac causes of cardiac arrest have worse outcomes.3 In 80% of cardiac arrests the patient has a non-shockable rhythm (pulseless electrical activity or asystole), for which survival to hospital discharge is around 15-20%.2 By contrast, the likelihood of survival from an initially shockable rhythm is 2-3 times higher (about 50%).2 However, these figures can be misleading because CPR will not be attempted in patients who are unlikely to survive resuscitation or the period of ventilation on an intensive care unit that often follows.

Renin-Angiotensin System Blockers and the COVID-19 Pandemic: At Present There Is No Evidence to Abandon Renin-Angiotensin System Blockers	Danser, A. H. Jan; Epstein, Murray; Batlle, Daniel	During the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, some reports of data still emerging and in need of full analysis indicate that certain groups of patients are at risk of COVID-19. This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly. Many of those patients are treated with reninangiotensin system blockers. Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. The present article discusses this concept. ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels. As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes. Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs. Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans. Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects. In summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.	2020	NA	Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)	NA	NA	HYPERTENSIONAHA12015082-HYPERTENSIONAHA12015082	NA	10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15082	16669	#15781	Danser 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15082	A.H.

The Role of Telehealth in Reducing the Mental Health Burden from COVID-19	Zhou, Xiaoyun; Snoswell, Centaine L.; Harding, Louise E.; Bambling, Matthew; Edirippulige, Sisira; Bai, Xuejun; Smith, Anthony C.	The psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic must be recognized alongside the physical symptoms for all those affected.1,2 Telehealth, or more specifically telemental health services, are practically feasible and appropriate for the support of patients, family members, and health service providers during this pandemic.3 As of March 18, 2020, there were >198,000 COVID-19 infections recorded globally, and 7,900 deaths. Psychological symptoms relating to COVID-19 have already been observed on a population level including anxiety-driven panic buying4 and paranoia about attending community events. Students, workers, and tourists who have been prevented from accessing their training institutions, workplaces, homes, respectively, are expected to have developed psychological symptoms due to stress and reduced autonomy and concerns about income, job, security, and so on.5 The Chinese, Singaporean, and Australian governments have highlighted the psychological side effects of COVID-19, and have voiced concerns regarding the long-term impacts of isolation and that the fear and panic in the community could cause more harm than COVID-19.6â€“8 In the absence of a medical cure for COVID-19, the global response is a simple public health strategy of isolation for those infected or at risk, reduced social contact to slow the spread of the virus, and simple hygiene such as hand washing to reduce the risk of infection. While the primary intervention of isolation may well achieve its goals, it leads to reduced access to support from family and friends, and degrades normal social support systems and causes loneliness, and is a risk for worsening anxiety and depressive symptoms.9 If left untreated, these psychological symptoms may have long-term health effects on patients and require treatment adding to the cost burden of managing the illness. Clinical and nonclinical staff are also at risk of psychological distress as they are expected to work longer hours with a high risk of exposure to the virus. This may also lead to stress, anxiety, burnout, depressive symptoms, and the need for sick or stress leave, which would have a negative impact on the capacity of the health system to provide services during the crisis.10 Treatment protocols for people with COVID-19 should address both the physiological and psychological needs of the patients and health service providers. Providing psychological treatment and support may reduce the burden of comorbid mental health conditions and ensure the wellbeing of those affected. Our challenge is to provide mental health services in the context of patient isolation, which highlights the role of telehealth (through videoconference, e-mail, telephone, or smartphone apps). The provision of mental health support (especially through telehealth) will likely help patients maintain psychological well-being and cope with acute and postacute health requirements more favorably. Examples of and evidence to support the effectiveness of telemental health are fairly diverse, especially in the context of depression,11 anxiety,12 and PTSD.13 Videoconferencing,14 online forums,15 smartphone apps,16 text-messaging,15 and e-mails17 have been shown to be useful communication methods for the delivery of mental health services. China is actively providing various telemental health services during the outbreak of COVID-19. These services are from government and academic agencies and include counseling, supervision, training, as well as psychoeducation through online platforms (e.g., hotline, WeChat, and Tencent QQ).18,19 Telemental health services have been prioritized for people at higher risk of exposure to COVID-19, including clinicians on the frontline, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and their families, policemen, and security guards. Early reports also showed how people in isolation actively sought online support to address mental health needs, which demonstrated both a population interest and acceptance of this medium.20 Additional telehealth services have been previously funded by the Aust alian Government (Better Access Initiative program), to address mental health needs of rural and remote patients during emergency situations,21 such as long-term drought and bushfires. In response to COVID-19, the Australian Government has responded with additional funded services through the Medicare Benefits Schedule, enabling a greater range of telehealth services to be delivered, including telehealth[truncated]	2020	NA	Telemedicine and e-Health	NA	NA	tmj.2020.0068-tmj.2020.0068	NA	10.1089/tmj.2020.0068	12443	#12022	Zhou 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1089/tmj.2020.0068	Address correspondence to: Xiaoyun Zhou, MMH, Centre for Online Health, The University of Queensland, Building 33, Ground Floor, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Queensland 4102, Australia                  E-mail Address:                 xiaoyun.zhou1@uqconnect.edu.auCentre for Online Health, Centre for Health Services Research, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.

Covid-19: India imposes lockdown for 21 days and cases rise	Pulla, Priyanka	The Indian government has announced a countrywide lockdown for three weeks starting at midnight on 24 March to slow the spread of covid-19 as the number of people testing positive in the country reached 563. Although most of these people had contact with travellers returning from countries affected by covid-19, a few had no such link, suggesting that community transmission may have begun in some Indian states. Prime minister Narendra Modi announced that all government offices would be shut for 21 days, except essential services such as the fire service, police, and hospitals. Several experts have welcomed the move, although it could result in food shortages and hurt those in the unorganised workforce.

Letter from China: covid-19 on the grapevine, on the internet, and in commerce	Mowbray, Heather	In medically murky times in China, people are turning to rumour, hope, and faith to protect themselves from the new coronavirus.

He was arrested for his efforts.

Our planning, preparedness, and understanding of transmission, protection, and treatment will have to change. Arguably, it was learning from the SARS pandemic that meant some South East Asian nations were better prepared for covid-19 and tackled it sooner.3 But what of the things we stop doing?

We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; and (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number R loc ). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high R loc , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low R loc benefit the most from policies that further reduce R loc . Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia, and Europe. We investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing. In December 2019, cases of unidentified pneumonia with a history of exposure in the Huanan Seafood Market were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified to be accountable for this disease. Human-to-human transmission is confirmed, and this disease (named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO)) spread rapidly around the country and the world. As of 18 February 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 75,199 with 2009 fatalities. The COVID-19 resulted in a much lower case-fatality rate (about 2.67%) among the confirmed cases, compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Among the symptom composition of the 45 fatality cases collected from the released official reports, the top four are fever, cough, short of breath, and chest tightness/pain. The major comorbidities of the fatality cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis. The source of the virus and the pathogenesis of this disease are still unconfirmed. No specific therapeutic drug has been found. The Chinese Government has initiated a level-1 public health response to prevent the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, it is also crucial to speed up the development of vaccines and drugs for treatment, which will enable us to defeat COVID-19 as soon as possible.	2020	NA	Journal of Clinical Medicine	9	2	NA	NA	10.3390/jcm9020571 10.3390/jcm9020575ER -	298	#1688	Boldog 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.3390/jcm9020571	Bolyai Institute	NA
To control the covid-19 outbreak, young, healthy patients should avoid the emergency department	Karan, Abraar	Young, healthy people with symptoms of covid-19 can help to prevent outbreaks in emergency departments where our societyâ€™s sickest will be seeking care, says Abraar Karan The situation with covid-19 is quickly evolving and coming to a critical point. As public health experts and doctors, itâ€™s been worrying to see the rapid spread of the virus and the relatively high hospitalisation ratesâ€”especially of those needing to be admitted to intensive care units. In these early phases of the epidemic, the case fatality rate is turning out to be much higher than seasonal flu. As we begin to see bigger outbreaks in more major cities, we are going to need a smart, systems level response, particularly while we donâ€™t have a vaccine, cure, or rapid diagnostic tests available. One critical action will be for young, healthy patients with mild symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, who may have covid-19, to avoid going to â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1040-m1040	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1040	9078	#8881	Karan 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1136/bmj.m1040	Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA 	('USA', 1)
COVID-19, ACE2 and the Cardiovascular Consequences	South, Andrew Michael; Diz, Debra; Chappell, Mark C.	The novel SARS coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may be particularly deleterious to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD). The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the requisite binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell. Recognition that ACE2 is the co-receptor for the coronavirus has prompted new therapeutic approaches to block the enzyme or reduce its expression to prevent the cellular entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in tissues that express ACE2 including lung, heart, kidney, brain, and gut. ACE2, however, is a key enzymatic component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); ACE2 degrades Ang II, a peptide with multiple actions that promote CVD, and generates Ang-(1-7) which antagonizes the effects of Ang II. Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that RAAS blockade by ACE inhibitors, AT(1) receptor antagonists and mineralocorticoid antagonists, as well as statins enhance ACE2 that, in part, contribute to the benefit of these regimens. In lieu of the fact that many older patients with hypertension or other CVDs are routinely treated with RAAS blockers and statins, new clinical concerns have developed regarding whether these patients are at greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether RAAS and statin therapy should be discontinued, and the potential consequences of RAAS blockade to COVID-19-related pathologies such as acute and chronic respiratory disease. The current perspective critically examines the evidence for ACE2 regulation by RAAS blockade and statins, the cardiovascular benefits of ACE2, and whether ACE2 blockade is a viable approach to attenuate COVID-19.	2020	NA	American journal of physiology.

Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza: A systematic review and meta-analysis	Long, Youlin; Hu, Tengyue; Liu, Liqin; Chen, Rui; Guo, Qiong; Yang, Liu; Cheng, Yifan; Huang, Jin; Du, Liang	Abstract Objective Previous meta-analyses concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of N95 respirators. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention of influenza by collecting randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods We searched PubMed, EMbase and The Cochrane Library from the inception to January 27, 2020 to identify relevant systematic reviews. The RCTs included in systematic reviews were identified. Then we searched the latest published RCTs from the above three databases and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished RCTs. Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted to calculate pooled estimates by using RevMan 5.3 software. Results A total of six RCTs involving 9 171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza (RRÂ =Â 1.09, 95% CI 0.92-1.28, PÂ >Â .05), laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections (RRÂ =Â 0.89, 95% CI 0.70-1.11), laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection (RRÂ =Â 0.74, 95% CI 0.42-1.29) and influenzalike illness (RRÂ =Â 0.61, 95% CI 0.33-1.14) using N95 respirators and surgical masks. Meta-analysis indicated a protective effect of N95 respirators against laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RRÂ =Â 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78). Conclusion The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza. It suggests that N95 respirators should not be recommended for general public and nonhigh-risk medical staff those are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients.	2020	NA	Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/jebm.12381	8628	#8439	Long 2020	NA	* Comparative study, RCT; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/jebm.12381	Chinese Evidence‐Based Medicine Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, P.R.

Bats have been recognized as one of the most important reservoirs for emerging viruses and the transmission of a coronavirus that originated in bats to humans via intermediate hosts was responsible for the high-impact emerging zoonosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (2-10) . Here we provide virological, epidemiological, evolutionary and experimental evidence that a novel HKU2-related bat coronavirus, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), is the aetiological agent that was responsible for a large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs in China that has caused the death of 24,693 piglets across four farms. Notably, the outbreak began in Guangdong province in the vicinity of the origin of the SARS pandemic. Furthermore, we identified SADS-related CoVs with 96-98% sequence identity in 9.8% (58 out of 591) of anal swabs collected from bats in Guangdong province during 2013-2016, predominantly in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) that are known reservoirs of SARS-related CoVs. We found that there were striking similarities between the SADS and SARS outbreaks in geographical, temporal, ecological and aetiological settings. This study highlights the importance of identifying coronavirus diversity and distribution in bats to mitigate future outbreaks that could threaten livestock, public health and economic growth.	2018	NA	Nature	556	7700	255-258	29618817	10.1038/s41586-018-0010-9	921	#1342	Zhou 2018	NA	Other related diseases and viruses; Reservoir; Virology, immunology	10.1038/s41586-018-0010-9	College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China	('China', 2)
Preliminary prediction of the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV	Zhou, Tao; Liu, Quanhui; Yang, Zimo; Liao, Jingyi; Yang, Kexin; Bai, Wei; Lu, Xin; Zhang, Wei	OBJECTIVES: To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). METHODS: Based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). RESULTS: The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the real-time reports on the number of 2019-nCoV-infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from international colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: The early transmission ability of 2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease with moderate to high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are needed to prevent the further transmissions.	2020	NA	J Evid Based Med	NA	NA	10.1111/jebm.12376	32048815	10.1111/jebm.12376	654	#707	Zhou 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology	10.1111/jebm.12376	College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065 China|College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065 China|College of Systems Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, 410073 China|College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065 China|College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065 China|College of Systems Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, 410073 China	('China', 6)

Epitope-based peptide vaccine design and target site depiction against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus: An immune-informatics study	Tahir Ul Qamar, M.; Saleem, S.; Ashfaq, U. A.; Bari, A.; Anwar, F.; Alqahtani, S.	Background: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-COV) is the main cause of lung and kidney infections in developing countries such as Saudi Arabia and South Korea. This infectious single-stranded, positive (+) sense RNA virus enters the host by binding to dipeptidyl-peptide receptors. Since no vaccine is yet available for MERS-COV, rapid case identification, isolation, and infection prevention strategies must be used to combat the spreading of MERS-COV infection. Additionally, there is a desperate need for vaccines and antiviral strategies. Methods: The present study used immuno-informatics and computational approaches to identify conserved B-and T cell epitopes for the MERS-COV spike (S) protein that may perform a significant role in eliciting the resistance response to MERS-COV infection. Results: Many conserved cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes and discontinuous and linear B-cell epitopes were predicted for the MERS-COV S protein, and their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B7 allele were estimated. Among B-cell epitopes, QLQMGFGITVQYGT displayed the highest antigenicity-score, and was immensely immunogenic. Among T-cell epitopes, MHC class-I peptide YKLQPLTFL and MHC class-II peptide YCILEPRSG were identified as highly antigenic. Furthermore, docking analyses revealed that the predicted peptides engaged in strong bonding with the HLA-B7 allele. Conclusion: The present study identified several MERS-COV S protein epitopes that are conserved among various isolates from different countries. The putative antigenic epitopes may prove effective as novel vaccines for eradication and combating of MERS-COV infection.	2019	NA	Journal of Translational Medicine	17	1	NA	NA	10.1186/s12967-019-2116-8	19	#21	TahirUlQamar 2019	NA	Other related diseases and viruses; Vaccines; Virology, immunology	10.1186/s12967-019-2116-8	College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, People‚Äôs Republic of China|Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Prince Sattam bin Abdul Aziz University, Alkharj, Saudi Arabia|Department of Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan|Department of Chemistry, University of Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan	('Pakistan', 2)|('China', 1)|('Saudi Arabia', 1)

Isolation and characterization of a bat SARS-like coronavirus that uses the ACE2 receptor	Ge, Xing-Yi; Li, Jia-Lu; Yang, Xing-Lou; Chmura, Aleksei A.; Zhu, Guangjian; Epstein, Jonathan H.; Mazet, Jonna K.; Hu, Ben; Zhang, Wei; Peng, Cheng; Zhang, Yu-Ji; Luo, Chu-Ming; Tan, Bing; Wang, Ning; Zhu, Yan; Crameri, Gary; Zhang, Shu-Yi; Wang, Lin-Fa; Daszak, Peter; Shi, Zheng-Li	The 2002-3 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was one of the most significant public health events in recent history. An ongoing outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus suggests that this group of viruses remains a key threat and that their distribution is wider than previously recognized. Although bats have been suggested to be the natural reservoirs of both viruses, attempts to isolate the progenitor virus of SARS-CoV from bats have been unsuccessful. Diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have now been reported from bats in China, Europe and Africa, but none is considered a direct progenitor of SARS-CoV because of their phylogenetic disparity from this virus and the inability of their spike proteins to use the SARS-CoV cellular receptor molecule, the human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here we report whole-genome sequences of two novel bat coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats (family: Rhinolophidae) in Yunnan, China: RsSHC014 and Rs3367. These viruses are far more closely related to SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat coronaviruses, particularly in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Most importantly, we report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat faecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1 also has a broad species tropism. Our results provide the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoVs. They also highlight the importance of pathogen-discovery programs targeting high-risk wildlife groups in emerging disease hotspots as a strategy for pandemic preparedness.	2013	NA	Nature	503	7477	535-538	24172901	10.1038/nature12711	916	#1398	Ge 2013	NA	* Narrative review; Epidemiology; Other related diseases and viruses; Reservoir; Virology, immunology	10.1038/nature12711	College of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200062, China	('China', 2)

Early estimation of the case fatality rate of COVID-19 in mainland China: a data-driven analysis	Yang, Shu; Cao, Peihua; Du, Peipei; Wu, Ziting; Zhuang, Zian; Yang, Lin; Yu, Xuan; Zhou, Qi; Feng, Xixi; Wang, Xiaohui; Li, Weiguo; Liu, Enmei; Chen, Ju; Chen, Yaolong; He, Daihai	BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2], named COVID-19, hit a major city of China, Wuhan in December 2019 and subsequently spread to other provinces/regions of China and overseas. Several studies have been done to estimate the basic reproduction number in the early phase of this outbreak, yet there are no reliable estimates of case fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19 to date. METHODS: In this study, we used a purely data-driven statistical method to estimate the CFR in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Daily numbers of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths were collected from January 10 to February 3, 2020 and divided into three clusters: Wuhan city, other cities of Hubei province, and other provinces of mainland China. Simple linear regression model was applied to estimate the CFR from each cluster. RESULTS: We estimated that CFR during the first weeks of the epidemic ranges from 0.15% (95% CI: 0.12-0.18%) in mainland China excluding Hubei through 1.41% (95% CI: 1.38-1.45%) in Hubei province excluding the city of Wuhan to 5.25% (95% CI: 4.98-5.51%) in Wuhan. CONCLUSIONS: Our early estimates suggest that the CFR of COVID-19 is lower than the previous coronavirus epidemics caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).	2020	NA	Annals of translational medicine	8	4	128-128	NA	10.21037/atm.2020.02.66	8890	#8648	Yang 2020	NA	* Case study/series; * Epidemiological study; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology	10.21037/atm.2020.02.66	College of Medical Information Engineering, |Department of Applied Mathematics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, |Department of Respiratory, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation base of Child development and Critical Disorders, 	('China', 1)

Effectiveness for the Response to COVID-19: The MERS Outbreak Containment Procedures	Cho, Hae-Wol	In the current issue of Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives, 3 studies are presented dealing with COVID-19. A study by Kim et al, analyzed the genetic information of the COVID-19 virus isolated from a patient in South Korea. The virus was identified by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR followed by Next Generation Sequencing of the full-length of the genome [5]. In an interim report by the COVID-19 National Emergency Response Center of the KCDC, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in 28 cases in South Korea were reported. There were 53.9% of cases who were males, with 16 cases in patients who had traveled abroad, of which 11 cases (39.3%) were from Wuhan, China, and 12 of the remaining cases were believed to have been infected in South Korea. The incubation period was 4.8 days. Most secondary infected cases were from family members outside the family home (66.7%) and within the family home (75%) [6].	2020	NA	Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives	11	1	2-Jan	NA	10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.1.01	2207	#2662	Cho 2020	NA	NA	10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.1.01	College of Medicine, Eulji University, Daejeon, Korea	NA
Critical care management of adults with community-acquired severe respiratory viral infection	Arabi, Yaseen M.; Fowler, Robert; Hayden, Frederick G.	With the expanding use of molecular assays, viral pathogens are increasingly recognized among critically ill adult patients with community-acquired severe respiratory illness; studies have detected respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in 17â€“53% of such patients. In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic coronaviruses like the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) are still being identified. Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza. At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for other severe RVIs. Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been studied for their immunomodulatory effects, including macrolides, corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, sirolimus, statins, anti-influenza immune plasma, and vitamin C, but none is recommended at present in severe RVIs. Evidence-based supportive care is the mainstay for management of severe respiratory viral infection. Non-invasive ventilation in patients with severe RVI causing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia is associated with a high likelihood of transition to invasive ventilation. Limited existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe RVI. There is a need for more pragmatic and efficient designs to test different therapeutics both individually and in combination.	2020	NA	Intensive Care Medicine	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s00134-020-05943-5	510	#684	Arabi 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Awaiting classification; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s00134-020-05943-5	College of Medicine, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia|Institute of Health Policy Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Sunnybrook Hospital, Toronto, Canada|Department of Medicine, Sunnybrook Hospital, Toronto, Canada|Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA	('Canada', 3)|('Saudi Arabia', 1)|('USA', 1)
A guideline for homology modeling of the proteins from newly discovered betacoronavirus, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)	Dong, Shengjie; Sun, Jiachen; Mao, Zhuo; Wang, Lu; Lu, Yi-Lin; Li, Jiesen	During an outbreak of respiratory diseases including atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, a previously unknown Î²-coronavirus was detected in patients. The newly discovered coronavirus is similar to some Î²-coronaviruses found in bats, but different from previously known SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. High sequence identities and similarities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV was found. In this work, we searched the homologous templates of all nonstructural and structural proteins of 2019-nCoV. Among the nonstructural proteins, the leader protein (nsp1), the papain-like protease (nsp3), the nsp4, the 3C-like protease (nsp5), the nsp7, the nsp8, the nsp9, the nsp10, the RNA-directed RNA polymerase (nsp12), the helicase (nsp13), the guanine-N7 methyltransferase (nsp14), the uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (nsp15), the 2'-O-methyltransferase (nsp16), and the ORF7a protein could be built on the basis of homology templates. Among the structural proteins, the spike protein (S-protein), the envelope protein (E-protein), and the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) can be constructed based on the crystal structures of the proteins from SARS-CoV. It is known that PL-Pro, 3CL-Pro, and RdRp are important targets for design antiviral drugs against 2019-nCoV. And S protein is critical target candidate for inhibitor screening or vaccine design against 2019-nCoV because coronavirus replication is initiated by the binding of S protein to cell surface receptors. It is believed that these proteins should be useful for further structure-based virtual screening and related computer-aided drug development and vaccine design.

Academic leadership in a time of crisis: The coronavirus and COVID-19	Fernandez, Antonio Arturo; Shaw, Graham Paul	The novel coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19 is one of the most unpredictable global public health crises in recent times. Academic leaders across the U.S. have responded by moving their educational and associated activities online; as a sense of immediacy swept the nation. The decision to pivot to remote learning was made swiftly, particularly by those institutions operating a shared leadership model, benefitting from a greater degree of agility, innovation, and collaboration. The current article highlights three of the leadership best practices for navigating unpredictable adaptive challenges such as that posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Firstly, by utilizing a type of servant leadership, that emphasizes empowerment, involvement and collaboration, academic leaders with emotional intelligence and emotional stability should place the interests of others above their own. Secondly, academic leaders should distribute leadership responsibilities to a network of teams throughout the organization to improve the quality of the decisions made in crisis resolution and thirdly, leaders should communicate clearly and frequently to all stakeholders through a variety of communication channels. Looking forward, the rise of the flexible ?allostatic leader? with the adaptive capacity to learn and evolve in crisis, to emerge better able to address future crises, is described.

Clinician Mental Health and Well-Being During Global Healthcare Crises: Evidence Learned From Prior Epidemics for COVID-19 Pandemic	Jun, Jin; Tucker, Sharon; Melnyk, Bernadette	Abstract Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is sweeping across the globe, having sickened more than 640,000 people and claimed over 30,000 lives in approximately 202 countries at the time of writing with no sign of slowing down (World Health Organization, 2020). Each time a pandemic or an epidemic disease occurs, such as measles, scarlet fever, HIV/AIDS, Ebola, or the flu of 2013, healthcare professionals are on the front lines, battling diseases and caring for sick and dying patients, even while knowingly putting themselves at risk (Borghese, Di Donato, Ruotolo, & Fiegender, 2020).	2020	NA	Worldviews on Evidence-Based Nursing	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/wvn.12439	31013	#31716	Jun-20	NA	NA	10.1111/wvn.12439	College of Nursing, Grayce Sills Endowed Professor in Psychiatric‚ÄêMental Health Nursing, Director, DNP Nurse Executive Track, Director, Translational/Implementation Research Core, Helene Fuld Health Trust National Institute for EBP, Ohio State University, Columbus, United States, Ohio|College of Nursing, Grayce Sills Endowed Professor in Psychiatric‚ÄêMental Health Nursing, Director, DNP Nurse Executive Track, Director, Translational/Implementation Research Core, Helene Fuld Health Trust National Institute for EBP, Ohio State University, Columbus, United States, Ohio	('United States', 2)
Achieve Research Continuity During Social Distancing by Rapidly Implementing Individual and Group Videoconferencing with Participants: Key Considerations, Best Practices, and Protocols	Marhefka, Stephanie; Lockhart, Elizabeth; Turner, DeAnne	The novel coronavirus has upended many traditional research procedures as universities and other research entities have closed to activate social distancing. Some social and behavioral research activities (e.g. data analysis, manuscript preparation) can be continued from other environments with appropriate security protocols in place. For studies involving in-person interactions, continuity may be more difficult. Phone-based interactions provide a low-tech solution that may suffice in some cases. Yet, videoconferencing platforms can nearly replicate in-person interactions, activating both auditory and visual senses and potentially resulting in more substantial engagement. Staff can meet with participants individually or in groups, each seeing and hearing one another in real time. This paper provides guidance for researchers transitioning in-person assessments and interventions to a synchronous videoconferencing platform. Best practices, key considerations, examples from the field, and sample protocols are presented to ease transition for ongoing studies and maximize the potential of videoconferencingâ€”and social distancing.	2020	NA	AIDS and Behavior	NA	NA	7-Jan	NA	10.1007/s10461-020-02837-x	30942	#30543	Marhefka 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s10461-020-02837-x	College of Public Health, University of South Florida, 13201 Bruce B.

Application of a Risk Analysis Tool to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Outbreak in Saudi Arabia	Chen, Xin; Chughtai, Abrar A.; MacIntyre, Chandini R.	The Grunow-Finke assessment tool (GFT) is an accepted scoring system for determining likelihood of an outbreak being unnatural in origin. Considering its high specificity but low sensitivity, a modified Grunow-Finke tool (mGFT) has been developed with improved sensitivity. The mGFT has been validated against some past disease outbreaks, but it has not been applied to ongoing outbreaks. This study is aimed to score the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia using both the original GFT and mGFT. The publicly available data on human cases of MERS-CoV infections reported in Saudi Arabia (2012-2018) were sourced from the FluTrackers, World Health Organization, Saudi Ministry of Health, and published literature associated with MERS outbreaks investigations. The risk assessment of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia was analyzed using the original GFT and mGFT criteria, algorithms, and thresholds. The scoring points for each criterion were determined by three researchers to minimize the subjectivity. The results showed 40 points of total possible 54 points using the original GFT (likelihood: 74%), and 40 points of a total possible 60 points (likelihood: 67%) using the mGFT, both tools indicating a high likelihood that human MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia is unnatural in origin. The findings simply flag unusual patterns in this outbreak, but do not prove unnatural etiology. Proof of bioattacks can only be obtained by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. This study demonstrated the value and flexibility of the mGFT in assessing and predicting the risk for an ongoing outbreak with simple criteria.	2020	NA	Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis	NA	NA	10.1111/risa.13472-10.1111/risa.13472	NA	10.1111/risa.13472	8742	#8362	Chen 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Other related diseases and viruses	10.1111/risa.13472	College of Public Service and Community Solutions, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA|College of Health Solutions, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA|College of Public Service and Community Solutions, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA|College of Health Solutions, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA	('USA', 4)
Fear can be more harmful than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in controlling the corona virus disease 2019 epidemic	Ren, Shi-Yan; Gao, Rong-Ding; Chen, Ye-Lin	The current corona virus disease 2019 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 started in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has put the world on alert. To safeguard Chinese citizens and to strengthen global health security, China has made great efforts to control the epidemic. Many in the global community have joined China to limit the epidemic. However, discrimination and prejudice driven by fear or misinformation have been flowing globally, superseding evidence and jeopardizing the anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 efforts. We analyze this phenomenon and its underlying causes and suggest practical solutions.	2020	NA	World J Clin Cases	8	4	652-657	32149049	10.12998/wjcc.v8.i4.652	6006	#5601	Ren 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Epidemiology; Ethics, social science, economics	10.12998/wjcc.v8.i4.652	College of Robotics, Beijing Union University, Beijing 100101, China	('China', 1)

A number of clinical workers and researchers have made great efforts to understand the pathogenesis and clinical characteristics and develop effective drugs for treatment. However, no effective drugs with antiviral effects on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have been discovered currently. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has gained abundant experience in the treatment of infectious diseases for thousands of years. In this review, the authors summarized the clinical outcome, pathogensis and current application of TCM on coronavirus disease 2019.

Surveillance and Taxonomic Analysis of the Coronavirus Dominant in Pigeons in China	Zhuang, Qingye; Liu, Shuo; Zhang, Xiaochun; Jiang, Wenming; Wang, Kaicheng; Wang, Suchun; Peng, Cheng; Hou, Guangyu; Li, Jinping; Yu, Xiaohui; Yuan, Liping; Wang, Jingjing; Li, Yang; Liu, Hualei; Chen, Jiming	Coronaviruses (CoVs) are found in humans and a wide variety of wild and domestic animals, and of substantial impact on human and animal health. In poultry, the genetic diversity, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy of CoVs dominant in birds other than chickens remain enigmatic. In our previous study, we proposed that the CoVs dominant (i.e., mainly circulating) in ducks (DdCoVs) should represent a novel species, which was different from the one represented by the CoVs dominant in chickens (CdCoVs). In this study, we conducted a large-scale surveillance of CoVs in chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons and other birds (quails, sparrows and partridges) using a conserved RT-PCR assay. The surveillance demonstrated that CdCoVs, DdCoVs and the CoVs dominant in pigeons (PdCoVs) belong to different lineages, and they are all prevalent in live poultry markets and the backyard flocks in some regions of China. We further sequenced seven Coronaviridae-wide conserved domains in their replicase polyprotein pp1ab of seven PdCoVs, and found that the genetic distances in these domains between PdCoVs and DdCoVs or CdCoVs are large enough to separate PdCoVs into a novel species, which were different from the ones represented by DdCoVs or CdCoVs within the genus Gammacoronavirus, per the species demarcation criterion of International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. This report shed novel insight into the genetic diversity, distribution, evolution, and taxonomy of avian CoVs.	2020	NA	Transboundary and emerging diseases	NA	NA	10.1111/tbed.13541-10.1111/tbed.13541	NA	10.1111/tbed.13541	8255	#8319	Zhuang 2020	NA	Other related diseases and viruses; Reservoir	10.1111/tbed.13541	College of Veterinary Medicine, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao, China|College of Veterinary Medicine, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao, China	('China', 2)
Potential utilities of mask wearing and instant hand hygiene for fighting SARS-CoV-2	Ma, Qing-Xia; Shan, Hu; Zhang, Hong-Liang; Li, Gui-Mei; Yang, Rui-Mei; Chen, Ji-Ming	Abstract Background The surge of patients in the pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 may overwhelm the medical systems of many countries. Mask wearing and hand washing can slow the spread of the virus, but currently masks are in shortage in many countries, and timely hand washing is often impossible. Methods The efficacy of three types of masks and instant hand wiping was evaluated using avian influenza virus to mock the coronavirus. Virus quantification was performed using real-time RT-PCR. Previous studies on mask wearing were reviewed. Results Instant hand wiping using a wet towel soaked in water containing 1.00% soap powder, 0.05% active chlorine, or 0.25% active chlorine from sodium hypochlorite removed 98.36%, 96.62%, and 99.98% of the virus from hands, respectively. N95 masks, medical masks, and homemade masks made of 4-layer kitchen paper and 1-layer cloth could block 99.98%, 97.14%, and 95.15% of the virus in aerosols. Medical mask wearing which was supported by many studies was opposed by other studies possibly due to erroneous judgment. With these data we propose the approach of mask wearing plus instant hand hygiene (MIH) to slow the exponential spread of the virus. This MIH approach has been supported by the experiences of seven countries in fighting against COVID-19.

Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among Chinese residents during the rapid rise period of the COVID-19 outbreak: a quick online cross-sectional survey	Zhong, Bao-Liang; Luo, Wei; Li, Hai-Mei; Zhang, Qian-Qian; Liu, Xiao-Ge; Li, Wen-Tian; Li, Yi	Unprecedented measures have been adopted to control the rapid spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in China. People's adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days. Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%. The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19. Nearly all of the participants (98.0%) wore masks when going out in recent days. In multiple logistic regression analyses, the COVID-19 knowledge score (OR: 0.75-0.90, P<0.001) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-2019. Most Chinese residents of a relatively high socioeconomic status, in particular women, are knowledgeable about COVID-19, hold optimistic attitudes, and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. Health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful for Chinese residents to hold optimistic attitudes and maintain appropriate practices. Due to the limited sample representativeness, we must be cautious when generalizing these findings to populations of a low socioeconomic status.	2020	NA	Int J Biol Sci	NA	NA	NA	32226294	10.7150/ijbs.45221	26948	#24919	Zhong 2020	NA	NA	10.7150/ijbs.45221	College students' knowledge, attitudes and adherence to public service announcements on Ebola in Nigeria: Suggestions for improving future Ebola prevention education programmes	('Niger', 1)

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and prevalence of chronic liver disease: A meta-analysis	Mantovani, Alessandro; Beatrice, Giorgia; Dalbeni, Andrea	Abstract At present, there is scarce information regarding the global prevalence of chronic liver disease in individuals with COVID-19 disease, which is become a global pandemic early. Aim of this study was to assess the overall prevalence of chronic liver disease among patients with COVID-19 disease by meta-analyzing data in observational studies and to investigate the relationship between liver damage and COVID-19 disease. We included 11 observational studies for a total of 2,034 adult individuals (median age 49 years [IQR 45-54], 57.2% men). The overall prevalence of chronic liver disease at baseline was 3% (95% CI 2-4%; I2=29.1%). Individuals with severe COVID-19 disease had relevant alterations of liver enzymes and coagulative profile, probably due to the innate immune response against the virus. Further studies are needed to better investigate the causes of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 disease and the effect of treatment for COVID-19 on the liver.	2020	NA	Liver International	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/liv.14465	31039	#31374	Mantovani 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/liv.14465	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: alessandro.mantovani@univr.it  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7271-6329 Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona, Verona, Italy Correspondence Dr. Alessandro Mantovani, MD, Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Piazzale Stefani, 1, 37126 Verona, Italy E‐mail: alessandro.mantovani@univr.itSearch for more papers by this author|Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona, Verona, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0402-4176 Section of General Medicine, Hypertension and Liver Unit, University and Azienda Ospedaliera, Universitaria Integrata of Verona, Verona, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: alessandro.mantovani@univr.it  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7271-6329 Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona, Verona, Italy Correspondence Dr. Alessandro Mantovani, MD, Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Piazzale Stefani, 1, 37126 Verona, Italy E‐mail: alessandro.mantovani@univr.itSearch for more papers by this author|Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona, Verona, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0402-4176 Section of General Medicine, Hypertension and Liver Unit, University and Azienda Ospedaliera, Universitaria Integrata of Verona, Verona, ItalySearch for more papers by this author 	('Italy', 8)
An outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a new coronavirus: what we know so far	Cheng, Allen C.; Williamson, Deborah A.	Information on the new virus and its impact is being updated constantly. We know that SARSâ€CoVâ€2 can cause severe disease, although active surveillance of contacts is required to define the milder end of the disease spectrum and to estimate the true hospitalisation and case fatality ratio. The cases reported to date suggest that most are older adults; it is currently unclear whether comorbidities reflect the age group affected or whether they are risk factors for severe disease.4, 5 Early studies using data before the institution of public health interventions in China suggest that SARSâ€CoVâ€2 is as transmissible as SARS coronavirus and probably more transmissible than influenza viruses.6, 7 The timing of infectiousness relative to symptom onset is a particularly important parameter with implications for public health control. While reports suggest that asymptomatic infection and transmission may result from minimally symptomatic cases, the contribution of this to transmission is not yet known.8 Careful analysis of early data suggests that the mean incubation period is 6 days, with a range of up to 14 days.9 Reports of large outbreaks, particularly associated with hospitals and closed communities, raise the possibility of â€œsuperspreadingâ€ events, a feature of previous coronavirus outbreaks.10 The importance of infection control is also reinforced by a report that 41% of cases in Wuhan were acquired nosocomially (including 40 health care workers and 17 patients).4	2020	NA	Medical Journal of Australia	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.5694/mja2.50530	5849	#5831	Cheng 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.5694/mja2.50530	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: allen.cheng@monash.edu  https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3152-116X Infection Prevention and Healthcare Epidemiology Unit, Alfred Health, Melbourne, VIC Monash University, Melbourne, VIC E-mail address: allen.cheng@monash.eduSearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7363-6665  Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC  Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, VICSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: allen.cheng@monash.edu  https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3152-116X Infection Prevention and Healthcare Epidemiology Unit, Alfred Health, Melbourne, VIC Monash University, Melbourne, VIC E-mail address: allen.cheng@monash.eduSearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7363-6665  Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC  Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, VICSearch for more papers by this author 	NA
An outbreak of <scp>COVID</scp> â€19 caused by a new coronavirus: what we know so far	Cheng, Allen C.; Williamson, Deborah A.	An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, now formally named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSâ€CoVâ€2) and causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVIDâ€19), emerged in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province in central China in December 2019. The first cases were noted as a cluster of patients with pneumonia who were all linked to a live animal market, and testing found the presence of a previously unknown coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that affect both animals and humans, and several (OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63) are a cause of the common cold.1, 2 However, two coronaviruses have previously caused significant outbreaks associated with more severe disease: the SARS coronavirus in 2002â€“2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus that emerged in 2012.1, 2 Chinese authorities and researchers should be commended for their rapid sharing of viral sequences which enabled laboratories worldwide to develop diagnostic tests within weeks of discovery of the pathogen.3 An Australian laboratory subsequently isolated the virus from a clinical sample (the first to do so outside of China), and rapidly shared this virus with relevant global agencies, further aiding diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine development efforts. Information on the new virus and its impact is being updated constantly. We know that SARSâ€CoVâ€2 can cause severe disease, although active surveillance of contacts is required to define the milder end of the disease spectrum and to estimate the true hospitalisation and case fatality ratio. The cases reported to date suggest that most are older adults; it is currently unclear whether comorbidities reflect the age group affected or whether they are risk factors for severe disease.4, 5 Early studies using data before the institution of public health interventions in China suggest that SARSâ€CoVâ€2 is as transmissible as SARS coronavirus and probably more transmissible than influenza viruses.6, 7 The timing of infectiousness relative to symptom onset is a particularly important parameter with implications for public health control. While reports suggest that asymptomatic infection and transmission may result from minimally symptomatic cases, the contribution of this to transmission is not yet known.8 Careful analysis of early data suggests that the mean incubation period is 6 days, with a range of up to 14 days.9 Reports of large outbreaks, particularly associated with hospitals and closed communities, raise the possibility of â€œsuperspreadingâ€ events, a feature of previous coronavirus outbreaks.10 The importance of infection control is also reinforced by a report that 41% of cases in Wuhan were acquired nosocomially (including 40 health care workers and 17 patients).4 As at 26 February 2020, there were 23 confirmed cases of COVIDâ€19 in Australia, across five jurisdictions. Although reported case numbers in China are slowing, large outbreaks on a cruise ship in Japan, and in South Korea, Iran and Italy are concerning and highlight our interconnected world. However, it is likely that this will change in the days or weeks ahead. Although absolute case numbers are small in Australia, the public health, political and societal ramifications have already been considerable, ranging from travel restrictions on nonâ€Australians coming from China, the use of offshore and remote quarantine facilities, and disturbing reports of racism against members of our Asian community (https://insigâ€‹htplus.mja.com.au/2020/5/coronâ€‹avirus-no-place-for-racism-xenopâ€‹hobia/).	2020	NA	Medical Journal of Australia	n/a	n/a	mja2.50530-mja2.50530	NA	10.5694/mja2.50530	5031	#5128	Cheng 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.5694/mja2.50530	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: allen.cheng@monash.edu  https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3152-116X Infection Prevention and Healthcare Epidemiology Unit, Alfred Health, Melbourne, VIC Monash University, Melbourne, VIC E-mail address: allen.cheng@monash.eduSearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7363-6665  Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC  Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, VICSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: allen.cheng@monash.edu  https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3152-116X Infection Prevention and Healthcare Epidemiology Unit, Alfred Health, Melbourne, VIC Monash University, Melbourne, VIC E-mail address: allen.cheng@monash.eduSearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7363-6665  Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC  Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, VICSearch for more papers by this author 	NA

COVID-19 and online teaching in higher education: A case study of Peking University	Bao, Wei	Abstract Starting from the spring of 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 caused Chinese universities to close the campuses and forced them to initiate online teaching. This paper focuses on a case of Peking University's online education. Six specific instructional strategies are presented to summarize current online teaching experiences for university instructors who might conduct online education in similar circumstances. The study concludes with five high-impact principles for online education: (a) high relevance between online instructional design and student learning, (b) effective delivery on online instructional information, (c) adequate support provided by faculty and teaching assistants to students; (d) high-quality participation to improve the breadth and depth of student's learning, and (e) contingency plan to deal with unexpected incidents of online education platforms.	2020	NA	Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/hbe2.191	37996	#38561	Bao 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/hbe2.191	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: baowei@pku.edu.cn  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4134-1667 Graduate School of Education, Institute of Education Economy, Peking University, Beijing, China Correspondence Wei Bao, Graduate School of Education, Institute of Education Economy, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China.

Obesity and its Implications for COVID-19 Mortality	Dietz, William; Santos-Burgoa, Carlos	Abstract A recent JAMA viewpoint regarding fatalities In Italy associated with the COVID-19 pandemic failed to mention obesity as one of the pre-existing diseases associated with death.1 It seems likely that the increased prevalence of obesity in Italy older adults compared to China may account for the differences in mortality between the two countries. Furthermore, the rising prevalence of obesity in the US and prior experience of the impact of obesity on mortality from H1N1 Influenza should increase the sensitivity of clinicians caring for patients with obesity and COVID-19 to the need for aggressive treatment of such patients.	2020	NA	Obesity	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/oby.22818	26096	#23894	Dietz 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/oby.22818	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: bdietz@gwu.edu  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6972-0925 Milken Institute School of Public Health, Department of Preventive and Community Health, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA Correspondence: William Dietz (E-mail address: bdietz@gwu.edu)             Search for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7650-8260 Milken Institute School of Public Health, Department of Global Health, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USASearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: bdietz@gwu.edu  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6972-0925 Milken Institute School of Public Health, Department of Preventive and Community Health, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA Correspondence: William Dietz (E-mail address: bdietz@gwu.edu)                   Search for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7650-8260 Milken Institute School of Public Health, Department of Global Health, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USASearch for more papers by this author 	('USA', 4)
The ongoing crises in China illustrate that the assessment of epidemics in isolation is no longer sufficient	Stoffel, Carla; Schuppers, Manon; Buholzer, Patrik; MuÃ±oz, Violeta; Lechner, Isabel; Sperling, Ulrich; KÃ¼ker, Susanne; De Nardi, Marco	Summary The interplay of simultaneous COVID-19, African swine fever, and avian influenza emergencies on global health and industries is constantly evolving and difficult to predict, and therefore warrants further scrutiny. The need for a health network of global scope for the rapid and open exchange of information needs to be strengthened in order to address ongoing and future epidemics under competing resources.	2020	NA	Transboundary and Emerging Diseases	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/tbed.13536	5016	#5243	Stoffel 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1111/tbed.13536	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: carla.stoffel@safoso.ch  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9210-3458 SAFOSO AG, Liebefeld, Switzerland Correspondence Carla Stoffel, SAFOSO AG, Waldeggstrasse 1, CH 3097 Liebefeld, Switzerland.

Clinical features of deaths in the novel coronavirus epidemic in China	Leung, Char	In response to the recent novel coronavirus outbreak originating in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, observations concerning novel coronavirus mortality are of urgent public health importance. The present work presents the first review of the fatal novel coronavirus cases in China. Clinical data of fatal cases published by the Chinese Government were studied. As of 2 February 2020, the clinical data of 46 fatal cases were identified. The case fatality rate was significantly higher in Hubei province than the rest of China. While 67% of all deceased patients were male, gender was unlikely to be associated with mortality. Diabetes was likely to be associated with mortality. There is, however, not yet sufficient evidence to support the association between hypertension and mortality as similar prevalence of hypertension was also observed in the Hubei population.	2020	NA	Reviews in medical virology	NA	NA	e2103-e2103	NA	10.1002/rmv.2103	8888	#8743	Leung 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1002/rmv.2103	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: char.leung@deakin.edu.au  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4215-4513 Deakin University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Correspondence Char Leung, Deakin University, 221 Burwood Highway, Melbourne, VIC 3125, Australia.

Senior Medical Students in the COVID-19 Response: An opportunity to be proactive	Stokes, Daniel C.	Abstract On March 13th, the United States (US) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic a national emergency. By March 18th, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 had spread to all 50 US states, with 7,038 cases and 97 deaths.1 The trajectory of cases mirrors that of Italy, where doctors are forced to consider who is more deserving of a ventilator.2 In response, social distancing measures are being promoted across the US in the hopes of slowing the growth in new cases, i.e. ?flattening the curve.? This could maintain the demand for acute care within the healthcare system?s capacity to treat.3 Travel has been curtailed, conferences and concerts cancelled, and schools and universities have moved students off campus and classes online. Medical schools are following suit, with added motivators. In canceling classes and rotations, medical schools hope to: promote social distancing, limit the risk of students contracting the virus, limit the number of healthcare workers who might spread the virus to unaffected patients, minimize the teaching burden on frontline providers, and preserve personal protective equipment (PPE) for essential personnel. These are logical reasons for removing students from hospitals. But, despite our best efforts, there may come a point in the US when, as is set to happen in Italy, medical demand outpaces medical capacity.2 If the same happens here, is there a plan in place for incorporating senior medical students into emergency relief efforts?	2020	NA	Academic Emergency Medicine	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/acem.13972	16012	#15465	Stokes 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1111/acem.13972	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: daniel.stokes@pennmedicine.upenn.edu  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9622-2761 Center for Emergency Care Policy and Research, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PASearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: daniel.stokes@pennmedicine.upenn.edu  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9622-2761 Center for Emergency Care Policy and Research, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PASearch for more papers by this author 	NA

Awake tracheal intubation in a suspected COVID-19 patient with critical airway obstruction	Ahmad, I.; Wade, S.; Langdon, A.; Chamarette, H.; Walsh, M.; Surda, P.	Summary We report the airway management of a patient suspected of being COVID-19 positive with impending airway obstruction requiring urgent surgical tracheostomy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an awake tracheal intubation in a suspected COVID-19 positive patient. Various modifications were put in place during the awake tracheal intubation and surgical tracheostomy procedures to minimise aerosol generation from the patient, such as avoiding high flow nasal oxygen, establishing conscious sedation with remifentanil prior to commencing airway topicalisation and avoiding trans-tracheal local anaesthetic infiltration. A multidisciplinary team discussion prior to performing the case highlighted aspects of both the airway management and the surgical procedure where particular care and modifications are required. There is a lack of national guidance for awake tracheal intubation and tracheostomy in COVID-19 cases. This report nevertheless addresses the key procedural modifications required.	2020	NA	Anaesthesia Reports	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/anr3.12041	34462	#35155	Ahmad 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/anr3.12041	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: drimranahmad1@gmail.com  Consultant Anaesthetist, Guy’s and St Thomas’ Foundation Trust, London, UK Correspondence Dr Imran Ahmad Email: drimranahmad1@gmail.comSearch for more papers by this author|Specialist Trainee, Guy’s and St Thomas’ Foundation Trust, London, UKSearch for more papers by this author|Core Trainee Department of Anaesthesia, Guy’s and St Thomas’ Foundation Trust, London, UKSearch for more papers by this author|Consultant Anaesthetist, Guy’s and St Thomas’ Foundation Trust, London, UKSearch for more papers by this author|Specialist Trainee, Guy’s and St Thomas’ Foundation Trust, London, UKSearch for more papers by this author|Consultant, Department of Ear Nose and Throat Surgery, Guy’s and St Thomas’ Foundation Trust, UKSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: drimranahmad1@gmail.com  Consultant Anaesthetist, Guy’s and St Thomas’ Foundation Trust, London, UK Correspondence Dr Imran Ahmad Email: drimranahmad1@gmail.comSearch for more papers by this author|Specialist Trainee, Guy’s and St Thomas’ Foundation Trust, London, UKSearch for more papers by this author|Core Trainee Department of Anaesthesia, Guy’s and St Thomas’ Foundation Trust, London, UKSearch for more papers by this author|Consultant Anaesthetist, Guy’s and St Thomas’ Foundation Trust, London, UKSearch for more papers by this author|Specialist Trainee, Guy’s and St Thomas’ Foundation Trust, London, UKSearch for more papers by this author|Consultant, Department of Ear Nose and Throat Surgery, Guy’s and St Thomas’ Foundation Trust, UKSearch for more papers by this author 	('UK', 12)

The world is changing fast!	Young, Charles	The world is changing fast! As of 9 February 2020, there now have been at least 813 deaths from a novel strain of coronavirus that is thought to have originated in Wuhan, China (2019-nCoV), at the end of 2019. These deaths are in the context of the 37 558 cases of 2019-nCov which have already been diagnosed in China and multiple other countries.1 In the United Kingdom (UK), recent research by University College London, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, has found that 1 in 20 UK teachers now report long-lasting mental health problems, illustrating a dramatic increase from around 1/100 teachers affected in this way in the 1990s.2 In the United States (US), a recent report by Accenture (Artificial Intelligence [AI]: Healthcare's new nervous system), estimates that AI in health will be worth around $6.6 billion by 2021 and that â€œâ€¦when combined, key clinical health AI applications can potentially create $150 billion in annual savings for the US healthcare economy by 2026.â€3 What do these facts and statistics have in common? Taken together they illustrate the massive range and rate of change in health and the responsibility of healthcare globally. In this context a valid question can be asked about the role of general medical journals such as the International Journal of Clinical Practice (IJCP). Having taken over as Editor in Chief of IJCP in January this year, I have the honour of leading an internationally renowned medical journal, with a team of extremely accomplished clinician editors, published by Wiley, one of the world's leading biomedical publishers. In our rapidly changing healthcare world, IJCP is eager, committed and ideally suited to undergo a transition process as well. As a team, our view is that in a healthcare environment of seemingly ever-increasing specialisation, one key role that a Journal such as ours should move to fulfil is to publish important, high quality medical research and opinion that will inform specialist clinicians about important general medical concepts, practical insights and recent advances. Similarly, we will also aim to inform generalists about key speciality medical advances that have relevance to generalists in the provision of care to their patients. In this work a foundational aspect of our editorial approach will be rather than looking for reasons to reject submissions, to clearly identify problems with submitted research and opinion if they exist, and work closely with authors to address these issues, allowing those authors to raise the quality of their work to the highest level. In that context, as well as continuing to publish submissions from internationally important clinicians and medical researchers worldwide, we also see that IJCP should aim to specifically encourage less experienced authors who nonetheless have important information to share with the global healthcare community. In this way, IJCP will drive forward its primary function of improving global health through the dissemination of world leading medical information and debate. The world is changing fast, and IJCP has the energy and vision to change with it!	2020	NA	International Journal of Clinical Practice	74	3	e13486	NA	10.1111/ijcp.13486	1452	#2076	Young 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1111/ijcp.13486	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: eic.ijcp@gmail.com  Editor in Chief, International Journal of Clinical PracticeSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: eic.ijcp@gmail.com  Editor in Chief, International Journal of Clinical PracticeSearch for more papers by this author 	NA
Cytologic and histologic samples from patients infected by the novel coronavirus 2019 SARS-CoV-2: An italian institutional experience focusing on biosafety procedures	Rossi, Esther Diana; Fadda, Guido; Mule, Antonino; Zannoni, Gian Franco; Rindi, Guido	The 2019 coronavirus pandemic, which started in Wuhan, China, spread around the globe with dramatic and lethal effects. From the initial Chinese epicenter, the European diaspora taxed the resources of several countries and especially those of Italy, which was forced into a complete social and economic shutdown. Infection by droplets contaminating hands and surfaces represents the main vehicle of diffusion of the virus. The common and strong efforts to contain the pandemic have relevant effects on the management of samples from histopathology laboratories. The current commentary reports and focuses on the protocols and guidelines in use at a large tertiary Italian hospital that accordingly are proposed for adoption in Italian laboratories as a potential model for national guidelines for the coronavirus emergency.	2020	NA	Cancer cytopathology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1002/cncy.22281	37854	#38690	Rossi 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/cncy.22281	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: esther.rossi@policlinicogemelli.it  https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3819-4229 Unit of Anatomic Pathology, Agostino Gemelli University Policlinic Foundation, IRCCS, Rome, Italy Corresponding Author: Esther Diana Rossi, MD, PhD, MIAC, Anatomic Pathology Section, Department of Life Sciences and Public Health, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Agostino Gemelli University policlinic Foundation, IRCCS, Largo Francesco Vito 1, 00168 Rome, Italy (E-mail address: esther.rossi@policlinicogemelli.it).

Informing Emergency Care for COVID-19 patients: The COVID-19 Emergency Department (COVED) Quality Improvement Project Protocol	O'Reilly, G. M.; Mitchell, R. D.; Noonan, M. P.; Hiller, R.; Mitra, B.; Brichko, L.; Luckhoff, C.; Paton, A.; Smit, D. V.; Santamaria, M. J.; Cameron, P. A.	There is an urgency to support Australian ED clinicians with real-time tools as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. The COVID-19 Emergency Department (COVED) Quality Improvement Project has commenced and will provide flexible and responsive clinical tools to determine the predictors of key ED-relevant clinical outcomes. The COVED Project includes all adult patients presenting to a participating ED and meeting contemporary testing criteria for COVID-19. Outcomes measured include being COVID-19 positive and requiring intensive respiratory support. The dataset has been embedded in the Electronic Medical Record and the COVED Registry has been developed. Regression methodology will be used to generate clinical prediction tools. This project will support EDs during this pandemic. This article is protected by copyright.

Antibodies to coronaviruses are higher in older compared with younger adults and binding antibodies are more sensitive than neutralizing antibodies in identifying coronavirus-associated illnesses	Gorse, G. J.; Donovan, M. M.; Patel, G. B.	Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are common causes of respiratory illnesses (RI) despite preexisting humoral immunity. Sera were obtained near the onset of RI and 3 to 4 weeks later as part of a prospective study of 200 subjects evaluated for RI from 2009 to 2013. Antibodies against common HCoV strains were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization assay comparing older adults with cardiopulmonary diseases (99 subjects) to younger, healthy adults (101 subjects). Virus shedding was detected in respiratory secretions by polymerase chain reaction. Of 43 HCoV-associated illnesses, 15 (35%) occurred in 14 older adults (aged â‰¥60 years) and 28 (65%) in 28 younger adults (aged 21-40 years). Binding and neutralizing antibodies were higher in older adults. Only 16 (35.7%) of RI with increases in binding antibodies also had increases in neutralizing antibodies to HCoV. Increases in binding antibodies with RI were more frequent than increased neutralizing antibodies and virus shedding, and more frequent in younger compared to older adults. Functional neutralizing antibodies were not stimulated as often as binding antibodies, explaining in part a susceptibility to reinfection with HCoV. Monitoring binding antibodies may be more sensitive for the serologic detection of HCoV infections.	2020	NA	Journal of Medical Virology	92	5	512-517	NA	10.1002/jmv.25715	25884	#27596	Gorse 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/jmv.25715	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: gorsegj@slu.edu  http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4558-2713 Section of Infectious Diseases, and Research and Development Service, VA Saint Louis Health Care System, Saint Louis, Missouri Division of Infectious Diseases, Allergy, and Immunology, School of Medicine, Saint Louis University, Saint Louis, Missouri Correspondence Geoffrey J.

Trust is a key factor in the willingness of health professionals to work during the COVID-19 outbreak: Experience from the H1N1 pandemic in Japan 2009	Imai, Hissei	On May 16, 2009, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital admitted the first domestically infected patient in Japan. The number of patients who were suspected as having H1N1 influenza grew to 1687 within two weeks. On May 27, when the mayor of Kobe city declared the emergency had subsided. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared H1N1 influenza as a pandemic on June 11, 2009. Details of this are described elsewhere4,5 . I am a psychiatrist but also worked at an outpatient unit that screened for H1N1 was worried about being infected. However, the chief of my department led the way by personally consulting at the outpatient unit, which motivated me to join as well. My experience made me conduct a cross-sectional survey about the willingness and hesitation to work during the H1N1 pandemic with 3635 employees at three core hospitals in Kobe city between June and July, 20096 .	2020	NA	Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/pcn.12995	2202	#2623	Imai 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Ethics, social science, economics	10.1111/pcn.12995	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: ihits@hotmail.com  https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3656-5188 Health Promotion and Human Behavior, Graduate School of Medicine/School of Public Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan Ohashi Clinic, Tokyo, JapanEmail:              ihits@hotmail.comSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: ihits@hotmail.com  https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3656-5188 Health Promotion and Human Behavior, Graduate School of Medicine/School of Public Health, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan Ohashi Clinic, Tokyo, JapanEmail:                    ihits@hotmail.comSearch for more papers by this author 	('Japan', 4)

Novel coronavirus treatment with ribavirin: Groundwork for evaluation concerning COVID-19	Khalili, Jahan S.; Zhu, Hai; Mak, Amanda; Yan, Yongqi; Zhu, Yi	Abstract Confronting the challenge of the outbreak of COVID-19 should sharpen our focus on global drug access as a key issue in anti-viral therapy testing. The testing and adoption of effective therapies for novel coronaviruses is hampered by the challenge of conducting controlled studies during a state of emergency. The access to direct anti-viral drugs such as ribavirin that have an existing inventory and reliable supply chain may be a priority consideration for therapies developed for the 2019-nCoV infection outbreaks and any strain variants that may emerge. Based on the direct anti-viral activity of ribavirin against 2019-nCoV in vitro and evidence for potency enhancement strategies developed during the prior SARS and MERS outbreaks, ribavirin may significantly impact our ability to end the lingering outbreaks in China and slow outbreaks in other countries. The apparent COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to follow dosage guidelines for treatment with ribavirin, test new therapeutic concepts, and conduct controlled testing to apply the scientific rigor required to address the controversy around this mainstay of anti-viral therapy.

COVID-19: protecting our ENT workforce	Tysome, James R.; Bhutta, Mahmood F.	Abstract As we write at the end of March 2020, the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is posing an urgent and significant threat to global health. It has become clear that the healthcare worker army that forms the front line are also at increased risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes this disease. In China 3.8% of all cases of COVID-19 were in healthcare workers, but 14.8% of those had severe or critical disease.1	2020	NA	Clinical Otolaryngology	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/coa.13542	31073	#30728	Tysome 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/coa.13542	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: james.tysome@addenbrookes.nhs.uk  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2483-8700 Cambridge University Hospitals, Cambridge, UK Correspondence James R.

Resilience or Resistance: A personal response to COVID-19	Cleland, Jennifer	Abstract Shortly after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization I sat in my office thinking about the future. The world was in lockdown but I refused to give up my expectations of the present and future, maintaining a Pollyannish outlook no matter what I read, heard or saw. This blithe optimism was facilitated by the fact I had just migrated, had not yet engaged fully with local mass and social media, and was out-of-synch with my former sources of information.	2020	NA	Medical Education	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/medu.14170	31035	#31650	Cleland 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/medu.14170	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: Jennifer.cleland@ntu.edu.sg  https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1433-9323 Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Clinical Sciences Building, Novena Campus, 11 Mandalay Road, Level 18, Singapore, Singapore, 308232 Corresponding author Email: Jennifer.cleland@ntu.edu.sgSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: Jennifer.cleland@ntu.edu.sg  https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1433-9323 Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Clinical Sciences Building, Novena Campus, 11 Mandalay Road, Level 18, Singapore, Singapore, 308232 Corresponding author Email: Jennifer.cleland@ntu.edu.sgSearch for more papers by this author 	('Singapore', 4)

Who could have predicted that this is the year in which we are called to prevent illness, promote health, care for the sick, and bring comfort to the dying, in ways that haven?t been seen since other pandemics (e.g., the flu pandemic of 1918 or the yellow fever epidemics that were experienced in the United States in 1793 and then in recurring waves).	2020	NA	Journal of Nursing Scholarship	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/jnu.12556	31043	#31194	Gennaro 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/jnu.12556	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: jns@stti.org  Boston College, Connell School of Nursing, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, Massachusetts, United States Correspondence Mail id: jns@stti.orgSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: jns@stti.org  Boston College, Connell School of Nursing, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, Massachusetts, United States Correspondence Mail id: jns@stti.orgSearch for more papers by this author 	('United States', 2)
Is nicotine exposure linked to cardiopulmonary vulnerability to COVID-19 in the general population?	Olds, J. L.; Kabbani, N.	The recent emergence of COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide crisis, with large populations locked down and transportation links severed. While approximately 80% of infected individuals have minimal symptoms, around 15-20% need to be hospitalized, greatly stressing global health care systems. As of March 10, the death rate appears to be about 3.4%, although this number is highly stratified among different populations. Here, we focus on those individuals who have been exposed to nicotine prior to their exposure to the virus. We predict that these individuals are "primed" to be at higher risk because nicotine can directly impact the putative receptor for the virus (ACE2) and lead to deleterious signaling in lung epithelial cells.	2020	NA	The FEBS journal	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/febs.15303	10240	#10071	Olds 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/febs.15303	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: jolds@gmu.edu  SCHAR School of Public Policy, George Mason University, Arlington, VA, USA Correspondence J. L. Olds, SCHAR School of Public Policy, George Mason University, Arlington VA 22201, USA Tel: (703) 993-2280 E‐mail: jolds@gmu.eduSearch for more papers by this author|School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USASearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: jolds@gmu.edu  SCHAR School of Public Policy, George Mason University, Arlington, VA, USA Correspondence J. L. Olds, SCHAR School of Public Policy, George Mason University, Arlington VA 22201, USA Tel: (703) 993-2280 E‐mail: jolds@gmu.eduSearch for more papers by this author|School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USASearch for more papers by this author 	('USA', 6)

Nowhere has coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) caused more infections than in New York, where there have been over 26,500 infections. Resources have been appropriately allocated towards combating this outbreak, but where does this leave patients with severe non-COVID-19 diseases?

Pathways for urology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic	Simonato, Alchiede; Giannarini, Gianluca; Abrate, Alberto; Bartoletti, Riccardo; Crestani, Alessandro; De Nunzio, Cosimo; Gregori, Andrea; Liguori, Giovanni; Novara, Giacomo; Pavan, Nicola; Trombetta, Carlo; Tubaro, Andrea; Porpiglia, Francesco; Ficarra, Vincenzo	The public health emergency caused by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a significant reallocation of health resources with a consequent reorganization of the clinical activities also in several urological centers. A panel of Italian urologists has agreed on a set of recommendations on pathways of pre-, intra- and post-operative care for urological patients undergoing urgent procedures or non-deferrable oncological interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Simplification of the diagnostic and staging pathway has to be prioritized in order to reduce hospital visits and consequently the risk of contagion. In absence of strict uniform regulations that impose the implementation of nasopharyngeal swabs, we recommend that an accurate triage for possible COVID-19 symptoms be performed both by telephone at home before hospitalization and at the time of hospitalization. We recommend that during hospital stay patients should be provided with as many instructions as possible to facilitate their return to, and stay at, home. Patients should be discharged under stable good conditions in order to minimize the risk of readmission. It is advisable to reduce or reschedule post-discharge controls and implement an adequate system of communication for telemonitoring discharged patients in order to reduce hospital visits.	2020	NA	Minerva urologica e nefrologica = The Italian journal of urology and nephrology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.23736/S0393-2249.20.03861-8	21078	#20797	Simonato 2020	NA	NA	10.23736/S0393-2249.20.03861-8	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: kanghao_cheong@sutd.edu.sg  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4475-5451 Science, Mathematics and Technology Cluster, Singapore University of Technology and Design, 8 Somapah Rd, Singapore, S487372 Singapore Corresponding Author: E-mail address: kanghao_cheong@sutd.edu.sgSearch for more papers by this author|Science, Mathematics and Technology Cluster, Singapore University of Technology and Design, 8 Somapah Rd, Singapore, S487372 SingaporeSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: kanghao_cheong@sutd.edu.sg  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4475-5451 Science, Mathematics and Technology Cluster, Singapore University of Technology and Design, 8 Somapah Rd, Singapore, S487372 Singapore Corresponding Author: E-mail address: kanghao_cheong@sutd.edu.sgSearch for more papers by this author|Science, Mathematics and Technology Cluster, Singapore University of Technology and Design, 8 Somapah Rd, Singapore, S487372 SingaporeSearch for more papers by this author 	('Singapore', 12)

Life in the pandemic: Social isolation and mental health	Usher, Kim; Bhullar, Navjot; Jackson, Debra	Abstract Quarantine or physical isolation, used for centuries to contain the spread of infection, isolates those who have (or may have) been infected by a contagious disease to control or limit contamination. The COVID-19, a novel coronavirus first reported in Wuhan, China in late 2019, has rapidly spread across the globe becoming a pandemic. Modern quarantine strategies have been imposed globally in an attempt to curtail the spread of the COVID-19 infection including short- to medium-term lockdowns, voluntary home curfew, restriction on the assembly of groups of people, cancellation of planned social and public events, closure of mass transit systems, and other travel restrictions.	2020	NA	Journal of Clinical Nursing	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/jocn.15290	34437	#34802	Usher 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/jocn.15290	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: kim.usher@une.edu.au  International Journal of Mental Health Nursing, School of Health, University of New England, Australia Corresponding author E-mail address: kim.usher@une.edu.auSearch for more papers by this author|School of Psychology, University of New England, AustraliaSearch for more papers by this author|Journal of Clinical Nursing &University of Technology Sydney, AustraliaSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: kim.usher@une.edu.au  International Journal of Mental Health Nursing, School of Health, University of New England, Australia Corresponding author E-mail address: kim.usher@une.edu.auSearch for more papers by this author|School of Psychology, University of New England, AustraliaSearch for more papers by this author|Journal of Clinical Nursing &University of Technology Sydney, AustraliaSearch for more papers by this author 	('Australia', 6)
Respiratory failure alone does not suggest central nervous system invasion by SARS-CoV-2	Turtle, Lance	Abstract Many viruses can occasionally gain entry into the human central nervous system (CNS), even if most of the disease they cause does not involve the CNS. In a recent review, Li and colleagues (J Med Virol doi: 10.1002/jmv.25728) propose that SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can enter the human CNS, based upon the observation that a number of patients need mechanical ventilation to treat respiratory failure. However, respiratory failure caused by pneumonia is clinically distinct from that caused by brain failure. The published clinical features of COVID-19 do not suggest that involvement of the CNS is common. The possibility of CNS entry by SARS-CoV-2 remains plausible, but unproven.

Coronaviruses and immunosuppressed patients. The facts during the third epidemic	D'Antiga, L.	Following the outbreak in China, the Lombardy region of Italy has become one of the areas of highest incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As the outbreak grew to a pandemic, many centres worldwide raised the concern that immunocompromised patients may be at high risk of developing a severe respiratory disease called COVID-19. Unlike common viral agents (such as Adenovirus, Rhinovirus, Norovirus, Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus), Coronaviruses have not shown to cause a more severe disease in immunosuppressed patients. For this family of viruses the host innate immune response appears the main driver of lung tissue damage during infection.	2020	NA	Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society	NA	NA	NA	32196933	10.1002/lt.25756	11642	#11495	D'Antiga 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1002/lt.25756	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: ldantiga@asst-pg23.it  Paediatric Hepatology Gastroenterology and Transplantation, Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy Correspondence Lorenzo D'Antiga, MD, Paediatric Hepatology, Gastroenterology and Transplantation, Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII, Piazza Oms 1, 24127 Bergamo Italy E‐mail: ldantiga@asst-pg23.itSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: ldantiga@asst-pg23.it  Paediatric Hepatology Gastroenterology and Transplantation, Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy Correspondence Lorenzo D'Antiga, MD, Paediatric Hepatology, Gastroenterology and Transplantation, Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII, Piazza Oms 1, 24127 Bergamo Italy E‐mail: ldantiga@asst-pg23.itSearch for more papers by this author 	('Italy', 4)

Battling COVID-19: Critical care and peri-operative healthcare resource management strategies in a tertiary academic medical centre in Singapore	Lee, C. C. M.; Thampi, S.; Lewin, B.; Lim, T. J. D.; Rippin, B.; Wong, W. H.; Agrawal, R. V.	Summary In December 2019, a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, China, and a novel coronavirus elucidated as the aetiologic agent. Although most initial cases occurred in China, the disease, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a pandemic and continues to spread rapidly with human-to-human transmission in many countries. This is the third novel coronavirus outbreak in the last two decades and presents an ensuing healthcare resource burden that threatens to overwhelm available healthcare resources. A study of the initial Chinese response has shown that there is a significant positive association between COVID-19 mortality and healthcare resource burden. Based on the Chinese experience, some 19% of COVID-19 cases develop severe or critical disease. This results in a need for adequate preparation and mobilisation of critical care resources to anticipate and adapt to a surge in COVID-19 case-load in order to mitigate morbidity and mortality.

Identification of Coronavirus Sequences in Carp cDNA from Wuhan, China	Conway, Michael J.	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus sequences were identified in two separate cDNA pools. The first pool was from a Carassius auratus (crusian carp) cell line and the second was from Ctenopharyngodon idella (grass carp) head kidney tissue. BLAST analysis suggests that these sequences belong to SARS-like coronaviruses, and that they aren't evolutionarily conserved in other species. Investigation of the submitting laboratories revealed that two laboratories from the Institute of Hydrobiology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan, China performed the research and submitted the cDNA libraries to GenBank. This institution is very close in proximity to the Wuhan South China Seafood Wholesale Market where SARS-CoV-2 first amplified in the human population. It is possible that these sequences are an artifact of the bioinformatics pipeline that was used. It is also possible that SARS-like coronaviruses are a common environmental pathogen in the region that may be in aquatic habitats. This article is protected by copyright.

Prepare to adapt: Blood supply and transfusion support during the first 2 weeks of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affecting Washington State	Pagano, M. B.; Hess, J. R.; Tsang, H. C.; Staley, E.; Gernsheimer, T.; Sen, N.; Clark, C.; Nester, T.; Bailey, C.; Alcorn, K.	BACKGROUND: The first coronavirus (COVID-19) case was reported in United States (US), in the state of Washington, approximately three months after the outbreak in Wuhan, China. Three weeks later, the US federal government declared the pandemic a national emergency. The number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases increased rather rapidly and changed routine daily activities of the community. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This brief report describes the response from the hospital, the regional blood center, and the hospital-based transfusion services to the events that took place in the community during the initial phases of the pandemic. RESULTS: In Washington State, the first week of March started with 4 confirmed cases and ended with 150; by the end of the second week of March there were more than 700 cases of confirmed COVID-19. During the first week, blood donations dropped significantly. Blood units provided from blood centers of non-affected areas of the country helped keep inventory stable and allow for routine hospital operations. The hospital-based transfusion service began prospective triaging of blood orders to monitor and prioritize blood utilization. In the second week, blood donations recovered, and the hospital postponed elective procedures to ensure staff and personal protective equipment were appropriate for the care of critical patients. CONCLUSION: As community activities are disrupted and hospital activities switch from routine operations to pandemic-focused and urgent care-oriented, the blood supply and utilization requires a number of transformations.	2020	NA	Transfusion	NA	NA	NA	32196983	10.1111/trf.15789	12282	#11287	Pagano 2020	NA	* Normative guidance; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/trf.15789	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: monibea@uw.edu  https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5183-6471 Transfusion Medicine Division, Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA Hematology Division, Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WAAddress reprint requests to: Monica B.

A Sentinel COVID-19 Case in Houston, Texas: Informing Frontline Emergency Department Screening and Preparedness	Lopez, Monica; Luber, Samuel; Prater, Samuel; Ostrosky-Zeichner, Luis; McCarthy, Jamie; Suarez, Guillermo; Bobrow, Bentley J.	Abstract In December 2019, a cluster of severe pneumonia cases of unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. A novel strain of coronavirus belonging to the same family of viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was identified. In February 2020, cases began being identified in the United States. We describe a sentinel CoVID-19 patient in Houston,Texas, who first presented on March 1, 2020. The patient did not meet criteria for a Person Under Investigation (PUI) as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) at the time. This case has broad implications for emergency department screening and preparedness for CoVID-19 and other future infectious diseases. This article is protected by copyright.

Lessons Never Learned: Crisis and gender-based violence	John, Neetu; Casey, Sara; Carino, Giselle; McGovern, Terry	Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic exposes underlying inequalities in our socio-economic and health systems, such as gender-based violence (GBV). In emergencies, particularly ones that involve quarantine, GBV often increases. Policymakers must utilize community expertise, technology and existing global guidelines to disrupt these trends in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic. Gender norms and roles relegating women to the realm of care work puts them on the frontlines in an epidemic, while often excluding them from developing the response. It is critical to value women?s roles in society and include their voices in the decision-making process to avoid unintended consequences and ensure a comprehensive response that caters to the needs of the most vulnerable groups.	2020	NA	Developing World Bioethics	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/dewb.12261	45171	#42127	John 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/dewb.12261	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: neetu.john@columbia.edu  https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8983-1211 Correspondence Neetu John, PhD, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.

Positive Externalities of an Epidemic: The Case of the Corona Virus (COVID-19) in China	Okyere, Michael Adu; Forson, Richmond; Essel-Gaisey, Felix	Abstract COVID-19 have undisputedly dented global economies as shown by indicators from the various stock markets. However, amidst these woes, China's quest to contain the spread of the pandemic and ultimately find its cure has resulted in some positive spillovers worth discussing. This commentary focuses on the positive effects that emanated from public policies and strategies enacted in China to control and ultimately to eradicate COVID-19. Specifically, these policies gave more room for testing futuristic technologies, reduce the spread of false information and pollution and provided social safety nets for affected individuals and firms.

Converting gas-driven ventilators from oxygen to air	Ford, P.; Foale, M.	During our preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic we identified that our GE Healthcare anaesthetic machines (GE Healthcare, Amersham Place, Little Chalfont, UK) had a ventilator which was gas-driven, using oxygen.

Why is COVID-19 so mild in children?	Brodin, Petter	Abstract There is an urgent need to understand why the course of the coronavirus that started in late 2019 (COVID-19) is affecting different groups of individuals with varying severity during the ongoing global pandemic. Greater knowledge of the disease, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), will help us to prioritise our limited health resources. Because the virus is new, and no vaccine is yet available, everyone is naÃ¯ve and susceptible to being infected with SARS-CoV2. The virus will continue to spread until an effective vaccine exists or sufficient members of our global population have been infected to establish herd immunity. At the moment, the best way to minimize loss of life and severe cases requiring intensive care is to try and shelter vulnerable groups of individuals and slow down the spread of the virus.	2020	NA	Acta Paediatrica	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/apa.15271	16013	#15459	Brodin 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1111/apa.15271	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: petter.brodin@ki.se  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8103-0046 Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden Unit of Pediatric Rheumatology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, SwedenSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: petter.brodin@ki.se  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8103-0046 Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden Unit of Pediatric Rheumatology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, SwedenSearch for more papers by this author 	('Sweden', 4)

Collecting and evaluating convalescent plasma for COVID-19 treatment: why and how	Tiberghien, Pierre; de Lambalerie, Xavier; Morel, Pascal; Gallian, Pierre; Lacombe, Karine; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan	Abstract Plasma provided by COVID-19 convalescent patients may provide therapeutic relief as the number CODID-19 cases escalate steeply world-wide. Prior findings in various viral respiratory diseases including SARS-CoV related pneumonia suggest that convalescent plasma can reduce mortality, although formal proof of efficacy is still lacking. By reducing viral spread early on, such an approach may possibly downplay subsequent immunopathology. Identifying, collecting, qualifying and preparing plasma from convalescent patients with adequate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Ab titers in an acute crisis setting may be challenging, although well within the remit of most blood establishments. Careful clinical evaluation should allow to quickly establish whether such passive immunotherapy, administered at early phases of the disease in patients at high risk of deleterious evolution may reduce the frequency of patient deterioration, and thereby COVID-19 mortality.	2020	NA	Vox Sanguinis	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/vox.12926	27144	#26729	Tiberghien 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/vox.12926	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: pierre.tiberghien@efs.sante.fr  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9310-8322 Etablissement Français du Sang, La Plaine‐St Denis, France UMR 1098 RIGHT, Inserm, EFS, Université de Franche‐Comté, Besançon, France Corresponding author email: pierre.tiberghien@efs.sante.frSearch for more papers by this author|Unité des Virus Émergents, UVE: Aix Marseille Univ, IRD 190, INSERM 1207, IHU Méditerranée Infection, 13005 Marseille, FranceSearch for more papers by this author|Etablissement Français du Sang, La Plaine‐St Denis, FranceSearch for more papers by this author|Etablissement Français du Sang, La Plaine‐St Denis, France Unité des Virus Émergents, UVE: Aix Marseille Univ, IRD 190, INSERM 1207, IHU Méditerranée Infection, 13005 Marseille, FranceSearch for more papers by this author|Sorbonne Université, Inserm IPLESP, Hôpital St Antoine, AP‐HP, Paris, FranceSearch for more papers by this author|REACTing Inserm, Paris, France APHP Hôpital Bichat, Paris, FranceSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: pierre.tiberghien@efs.sante.fr  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9310-8322 Etablissement Français du Sang, La Plaine‐St Denis, France UMR 1098 RIGHT, Inserm, EFS, Université de Franche‐Comté, Besançon, France Corresponding author email: pierre.tiberghien@efs.sante.frSearch for more papers by this author|Unité des Virus Émergents, UVE: Aix Marseille Univ, IRD 190, INSERM 1207, IHU Méditerranée Infection, 13005 Marseille, FranceSearch for more papers by this author|Etablissement Français du Sang, La Plaine‐St Denis, FranceSearch for more papers by this author|Etablissement Français du Sang, La Plaine‐St Denis, France Unité des Virus Émergents, UVE: Aix Marseille Univ, IRD 190, INSERM 1207, IHU Méditerranée Infection, 13005 Marseille, FranceSearch for more papers by this author|Sorbonne Université, Inserm IPLESP, Hôpital St Antoine, AP‐HP, Paris, FranceSearch for more papers by this author|REACTing Inserm, Paris, France APHP Hôpital Bichat, Paris, FranceSearch for more papers by this author 	('France', 18)
Generalized Pustular Figurate Erythema A Newly Delineated Severe Cutaneous Drug Reaction Linked with Hydroxychloroquine	Schwartz, Robert A.; Janniger, Camila K.	Abstract A severe cutaneous drug reaction resembling acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis resulting from ingestion of hydroxychloroquine has been documented. It is distinguishable by its longer incubation period, more varied morphology with initially urticarial and later targetoid and arcuate plaques, recalcitrance to therapy and longer duration. Given the anticipated surge in the use of hydroxychloroquine due to its reported benefits in those with coronavirus-19 infection, specific recognition of this entity is pivotal. We delineate it as generalized pustular figurate erythema (GPFE). This article is protected by copyright.

Sicken Thy Neighbour: The Initial Trade Policy Response to COVID-19	Evenett, Simon J.	Abstract In our interconnected world, whenever a global crisis occurs governments must decide whether discriminating against foreign suppliers is part of the solution?or whether foreign know-how and resources can be tapped for mutual advantage. Decisions to sacrifice open borders on the altar of some other goal are typically influenced by the steps?real or perceived?taken by other governments. At such times, written and unwritten international rules are tested, with consequences that can last well after the crisis dominated headlines.

Hospital biopreparedness in the Looming Presence of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19	Popescu, Saskia	The recent analysis of 138 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, and their clinical characteristics, has given credence to stronger investments into hospital biopreparedness and overall infection prevention efforts.1 Within this analysis, researchers found two pieces that are particularly relevant to healthcare preparedness: first, that 26% of patients required admission to an intensive care unit, and second, that 41% of cases were related to healthcare transmission. Patients requiring medical care in an intensive care unit inherently burden the system more, both in terms of supplies in personnel, but also because they typically have greater lengths of stay. The volume of healthcareâ€associated cases is an indicator of infection prevention breakdowns, which points to the potential for hospitals to further spread the disease. This is not a unique finding, however, and similar situations have been observed in previous coronavirus outbreaks. Indeed, hospitals can easily act as amplifiers for disease transmission during these events. In 2003, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARSâ€CoV) outbreak in Toronto highlighted this very real vulnerability, where busy emergency departments, delays in isolation, and improper personal protective equipment (PPE) use fueled the spread of disease in several hospitals.2 Enhanced infection prevention measures were eventually implemented (higher level of PPE, masking when in public areas, among others), which helped bring transmission to halt. After the outbreak was believed to be over, however, directives were given to discontinue those enhanced infection prevention measures. As a result of this and staff no longer routinely wearing masks in general hospital areas, a second phase of the outbreak began. An overwhelming majority of cases in Phase II of the Toronto SARSâ€CoV were related to healthcare transmission.3	2020	NA	Health Science Reports	n/a	n/a	e00149	NA	10.1002/hsr2.149	5843	#5577	Popescu 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Infection prevention and control	10.1002/hsr2.149	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: spopesc2@gmu.edu  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1521-8139 School of Public Policy, Biodefense, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, USA HonorHealth, Phoenix, Arizona, USA Correspondence Saskia Popescu, School of Public Policy, BiodefenseGeorge Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, USA.

COVID-19: Important Therapy Considerations and Approaches in this Hour of Need	Lodise, Thomas P.; Rybak, Michael J.	Abstract We are living in unprecedented times. While we had near pandemic events in the recent past with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), we have never experienced anything like coronavirus (COVID-19), also known as SARS-CoV-2 infection, since the Spanish flu. In contrast to the Spanish flu where medical care was limited, we are equipped to combat COVID-19 but there is considerable work ahead with many uncertainties. At this critical time, we must come together as one united country and world to stop the spread and provide the best care possible for individuals who contract the virus and develop infection. A number of novel and repurposed therapies agents with activity against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified and most institutions have developed clinical pathways to operationalize their use in appropriate COVID-19 patients.1-3 However, optimal drug therapy decisions for those with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections are extremely challenging at this time as evidence is limited.	2020	NA	Pharmacotherapy: The Journal of Human Pharmacology and Drug Therapy	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/phar.2396	45186	#42040	Lodise 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/phar.2396	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: thomas.lodise@acphs.edu  Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Albany, NY, United States Corresponding author Email: thomas.lodise@acphs.eduSearch for more papers by this author|Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, United StatesSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: thomas.lodise@acphs.edu  Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Albany, NY, United States Corresponding author Email: thomas.lodise@acphs.eduSearch for more papers by this author|Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, United StatesSearch for more papers by this author 	('United States', 4)
2019_nCoV/SARS-CoV-2: rapid classification of betacoronaviruses and identification of Traditional Chinese Medicine as potential origin of zoonotic coronaviruses	Wassenaar, T. M.; Zou, Y.	The current outbreak of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus, 2019_nCoV(now named SARS-CoV-2), illustrated difficulties in identifying a novel coronavirus and its natural host, as the coding sequences of various Betacoronavirus species can be highly diverse. By means of whole-genome sequence comparisons, we demonstrate that the noncoding flanks of the viral genome can be used to correctly separate the recognized four betacoronavirus subspecies. The conservation would be sufficient to define target sequences that could, in theory, classify novel virus species into their subspecies. Only 253 upstream noncoding sequences of Sarbecovirus are sufficient to identify genetic similarities between species of this subgenus. Furthermore, it was investigated which bat species have commercial value in China, and would thus likely be handled for trading purposes. A number of coronavirus genomes have been published that were obtained from such bat species. These bats are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and their handling poses a potential risk to cause zoonotic coronavirus epidemics. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The noncoding upstream and downstream flanks of coronavirus genomes allow for rapid classification of novel Betacoronavirus species and correct identification of genetic relationships. Although bats are the likely natural host of 2019_nCoV, the exact bat species that serves as the natural host of the virus remains as yet unknown. Chinese bat species with commercial value were identified as natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Since their trading provides a potential risk for spreading zoonoses, a change in these practices is highly recommended.	2020	NA	Letters in applied microbiology	NA	NA	NA	MEDLINE:32060933	10.1111/lam.13285	4322	#4187	Wassenaar 2020	NA	Reservoir; Virology, immunology	10.1111/lam.13285	Corresponding Author  E-mail address: trudy@mmgc.eu  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7024-1139 Molecular Microbiology and Genomics Consultants, Zotzenheim, Germany Correspondence Trudy M.

Potential of large 'first generation' human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV	Li, X.; Zai, J.; Wang, X.; Li, Y.	To investigate the genetic diversity, time origin, and evolutionary history of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and Thailand, a total of 12 genome sequences of the virus with known sampling date (24 December 2019 and 13 January 2020) and geographic location (primarily Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, but also Bangkok, Thailand) were analyzed. Phylogenetic and likelihood-mapping analyses of these genome sequences were performed. Based on our results, the star-like signal and topology of 2019-nCoV may be indicative of potentially large 'first generation' human-to-human virus transmission. We estimated that 2019-nCoV likely originated in Wuhan on 9 November 2019 (95% credible interval: 25 September 2019 and 19 December 2019), and that Wuhan is the major hub for the spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and elsewhere. Our results could be useful for designing effective prevention strategies for 2019-nCoV in China and beyond. This article is protected by copyright.

Global challenges in health and health care for nurses and midwives everywhere	Catton, H.	The next decade is likely to produce any number of global challenges that will affect health and health care, including pan-national infections such as the new coronavirus COVID-19 and others that will be related to global warming. Nurses will be required to react to these events, even though they will also be affected as ordinary citizens. The future resilience of healthcare services will depend on having sufficient numbers of nurses who are adequately resourced to face the coming challenges.	2020	NA	Int Nurs Rev	67	1	6-Apr	32083728	10.1111/inr.12578	129	#1682	Catton 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1111/inr.12578	Corresponding Author Chief Executive Officer  E-mail address: catton@icn.ch  International Council of Nurses, Geneva, SwitzerlandSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author Chief Executive Officer  E-mail address: catton@icn.ch  International Council of Nurses, Geneva, SwitzerlandSearch for more papers by this author 	('Switzerland', 2)

COVID-19 treatment by repurposing drugs until the vaccine is in sight	Phadke, Mrudula; Saunik, Sujata	Corona virus disease (COVID-19) has created pandemic in the world as declared by WHO on March 12, 2020. It is a viral disease caused by SARS-CoV 2 virus and has affected large populations in over 120 countries. There is no specific treatment available and management is empirical. Until such time that an effective vaccine is available for COVID-19 viral infection, one can repurpose known therapeutic drug molecules such as angiotensin receptor 2 blocker, a commonly used antihypertensive drug, to control COVID-19 virus from gaining entry into the host cell by blocking the angiotensin receptor. Clinical trials should also be undertaken to use statins, which are lipid-lowering drugs but have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties to prevent acute lung injury in COVID-19 infection.	2020	NA	Drug development research	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1002/ddr.21666	26177	#23356	Phadke 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/ddr.21666	Corresponding Author Sr. Adv  E-mail address: drmapaa@yahoo.com  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1138-6899 NHM, Government of Maharashtra, UNICEF, Maharashtra University of Health Sciences, Nashik, Maharashtra, India Correspondence M.

Design Retrospective case series. Setting Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Participants Among a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed. Data were collected until 28 February 2020. Main outcome measures Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms. Results The median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years). Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%). Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)). Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)). The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days. Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively. Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%). Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications. Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients. Conclusion Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.	2020	NA	BMJ	1091	March	m1091-m1091	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1091	21006	#20669	Chen 2020	NA	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1091	Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China|Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Paediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care Medicine	('China', 4)

We aimed to delineate and compare the immunologic features of severe and moderate COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical and immunologic characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the Guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China. RESULTS: The median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough and fatigue. Compared to moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-Î±. Absolute number of T lymphocytes, CD4+T and CD8+T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5 and 89.0 Ã— 106/L) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5 and 254.0 Ã— 106/L). The expressions of IFN-Î³ by CD4+T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1%) than moderate cases (22.8%). CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes particularly CD4+T and CD8+ T cells, resulting in decrease in numbers as well as IFN-Î³ production. These potential immunological markers may be of importance due to their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19.	2020	NA	The Journal of clinical

Successful containment of COVID-19: the WHO-Report on the COVID-19 outbreak in China	Salzberger, Bernd; GlÃ¼ck, Thomas; Ehrenstein, Boris	SARS-CoV-2 is a new Coronavirus, with first infections detected in humans late in 2019. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a large outbreak in China and is currently causing outbreaks in many countries. The disease spectrum ranges from uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infections to severe viral pneumonia with multiorgan failure and death. It can be transmitted by droplets from asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic patients and possibly through aerosols in health care environments. The route of transmission and the spectrum of disease (COVID-19) has motivated many researchers to use models of influenza outbreaks or pandemics to forecast outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 by analogy. The epicenter of Chinaâ€™s outbreak has been Wuhan and the Hubei province. The Chinese government has restricted travel from and to Hubei province and has implemented a number of measures to contain the outbreak. Meanwhile, the number of new cases per day in China is falling. A WHO mission has visited China and Wuhan to report on the outbreak. They corroborated the outbreak dynamic and case count reported by the Chinese government [2].	2020	NA	Infection	NA	NA	3-Jan	NA	10.1007/s15010-020-01409-4	9143	#8896	Salzberger 2020	NA	* Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Epidemiology; Infection prevention and control	10.1007/s15010-020-01409-4	Department Infection Control and Infectious Disease, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany|Department Internal Medicine, Kreisklinikum Trostberg, Trostberg, Germany|Department Rheumatology, Asklepios Medical Center, Bad Abbach, Germany	('Germany', 3)

Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibition in Cardiovascular Patients at the Time of COVID19: Much Ado for Nothing? A Statement of Activity from the Directors of the Board and the Scientific Directors of the Italian Society of Hypertension	Iaccarino, Guido; Borghi, Claudio; Cicero, Arrigo F. G.; Ferri, Claudio; Minuz, Pietro; Muiesan, Maria Lorenza; Mulatero, Paolo; MulÃ¨, Giuseppe; Pucci, Giacomo; Salvetti, Massimo; Savoia, Carmine; Sechi, Leonardo Alberto; Volpe, Massimo; Grassi, Guido	Cardiovascular diseases, in particular hypertension, as well as the cardiovascular treatment with Reninâ€“Angiotensin System inhibitors such as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs), are claimed once again as mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) during the COVID-19 outbreak due to Cov-2 epidemics. In vitro studies are available to support the eventual role of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in both the promotion and antagonism of the disease. The available literature, indeed, presents contrasting results, all concentrated in experimental models. Evidence in humans is lacking that those mechanisms areÂ actually occurring in the present COVID-19 outbreak. Here we present the reasoned statement of the Italian Society of Hypertension to maintain ongoing antihypertensive treatments. Furthermore, the Italian Society of Hypertension presents its own initiative to investigate the issue using an online questionnaire to collect relevant data in human disease.	2020	NA	High Blood Pressure & Cardiovascular Prevention	NA	NA	4-Jan	NA	10.1007/s40292-020-00380-3	37959	#38562	Iaccarino 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s40292-020-00380-3	Department of Advanced Biomedical Sciences, Federico II University, Naples, Italy|Department of Medicine and Surgery Sciences, Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy|Department of Clinical Medicine, Public Health, Life and Environment Sciences, University of Aquila, L‚ÄôAquila, Italy|Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy|Department of Health Promotion, Mother and Child Care, Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties, Unit of Nephrology and Hypertension, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy|Department of Medical Area, University of Udine, Udine, Italy|Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy	('Italy', 7)
A nationwide survey of psychological distress among Chinese people in the COVID-19 epidemic: implications and policy recommendations	Qiu, J.; Shen, B.; Zhao, M.; Wang, Z.; Xie, B.; Xu, Y.	The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic emerged in Wuhan, China, spread nationwide and then onto half a dozen other countries between December 2019 and early 2020. The implementation of unprecedented strict quarantine measures in China has kept a large number of people in isolation and affected many aspects of people's lives. It has also triggered a wide variety of psychological problems, such as panic disorder, anxiety and depression. This study is the first nationwide large-scale survey of psychological distress in the general population of China during the COVID-19 epidemic.	2020	NA	General psychiatry	33	2	e100213	32215365	10.1136/gpsych-2020-100213	18679	#18561	Qiu 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.1136/gpsych-2020-100213	Department of AI Health Informatics	NA
Clinical characteristics of 140 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China	Zhang, Jin-Jin; Dong, Xiang; Cao, Yi-Yuan; Yuan, Ya-Dong; Yang, Yi-Bin; Yan, You-Qin; Akdis, Cezmi A.; Gao, Ya-Dong	BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been widely spread. We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0years. All patients were community-acquired cases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) patients and current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) was the most common sign of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r=.486, P<.001) and nonsevere (r=.469, P<.001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to nonsevere patients (all P<.001). CONCLUSION: Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Older age, high number of comorbidities, and more prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe patients.	2020	NA	Allergy	NA	NA	NA	MEDLINE:32077115	10.1111/all.14238	4245	#4290	Zhang 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/all.14238	Department of Allergology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Allergology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Radiology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Infectious Disease, No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan, Wuhan, China|Department of Allergology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Allergology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Allergology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Radiology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Infectious Disease, No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan, Wuhan, China|Department of Allergology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China	('China', 14)

Eleven Faces of Coronavirus Disease 2019	Dong, X.; Cao, Y. Y.; Lu, X. X.; Zhang, J. J.; Du, H.; Yan, Y. Q.; Akdis, C. A.; Gao, Y. D.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has recently spread worldwide and been declared a pandemic. We aim to describe here the various clinical presentations of this disease by examining eleven cases. METHODS: Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images are discussed. RESULTS: The clinical course of the eleven cases demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical presentations. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses. Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were more severe. CONCLUSION: All different clinical characteristics of COVID-19 should be taken into consideration to identify patients that need to be in strict quarantine for the efficient containment of the pandemic.	2020	NA	Allergy	NA	NA	NA	32196678	10.1111/all.14289	11646	#11481	Dong 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology	10.1111/all.14289	Department of Allergology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Radiology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Respiratory Medicine, Wuhan Children‚Äôs Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Allergology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Respiratory Medicine, Wuhan Children‚Äôs Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Infectious Disease, No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan, Wuhan, China|Department of Allergology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Allergology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Radiology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Respiratory Medicine, Wuhan Children‚Äôs Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Allergology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Respiratory Medicine, Wuhan Children‚Äôs Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Infectious Disease, No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan, Wuhan, China|Department of Allergology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China	('China', 14)
The use of high-flow nasal oxygen in COVID-19	Lyons, C.; Callaghan, M.	Abstract The key healthcare challenge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the safe delivery of respiratory support on a large scale. The care of critically ill COVID-19 patients is guided by our knowledge and experience with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but this crisis is pushing patients and their clinicians into unchartered territories. One of the key decisions faced by healthcare systems is in selecting the appropriate devices for oxygen administration. The use of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) in COVID-19 is the subject of much debate, relating to the benefits and harms that may result for patients and healthcare workers alike.	2020	NA	Anaesthesia	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/anae.15073	31080	#30796	Lyons 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/anae.15073	Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland|Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Galway University Hospitals, Galway, Ireland|Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland|Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Galway University Hospitals, Galway, Ireland	('Ireland', 4)
Personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic â€“ a narrative review	Cook, T. M.	Summary Personal protective equipment has become an important and emotive subject during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic. COVID-19 is predominantly caused by contact or droplet transmission attributed to relatively large respiratory particles which are subject to gravitational forces and travel only approximately one metre from the patient. Airborne transmission may occur if patient respiratory activity or medical procedures generate respiratory aerosols. These aerosols contain particles that may travel much longer distances and remain airborne longer, but their infective potential is uncertain. Contact, droplet and airborne transmission are each relevant during airway manoeuvres in infected patients, particularly during tracheal intubation. Personal protective equipment is an important component, but only one part, of a system protecting staff and other patients from COVID-19 cross-infection. Appropriate use significantly reduces risk of viral transmission. Personal protective equipment should logically be matched to the potential mode of viral transmission occurring during patient care ? contact, droplet, or airborne. Recommendations from international organisations are broadly consistent, but equipment use is not. Only airborne precautions include a fitted high-filtration mask, and this should be reserved for aerosol-generating procedures. Uncertainty remains around certain details of personal protective equipment including use of hoods, mask type and the potential for re-use of equipment.	2020	NA	Anaesthesia	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/anae.15071	31081	#30793	Cook 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/anae.15071	Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Royal United Hospital NHS Trust, Bath, UK|Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Royal United Hospital NHS Trust, Bath, UK	('UK', 2)

Immunosuppression drug-related and clinical manifestation of Coronavirus disease 2019: a therapeutical hypothesis	Antonio, Romanelli; Silvia, Mascolo	Abstract We read with interest the article of Guillen et al. 1. Here, the authors described the management of a kidney transplanted patient infected by SARS-CoV-2 that causes novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The authors stated that immunosuppressed patients might present with atypical clinical manifestation (fever, diarrhea, fatigue) without respiratory symptoms. Also Li and colleagues 2 reported SARS-CoV-2 infection in two solid organ transplanted patients. The two heart transplanted patients presented with variable severity of COVID-19 (one mild and another with more severe manifestations requiring a prolonged hospitalization), however, both survived the event.	2020	NA	American Journal of Transplantation	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/ajt.15905	31086	#30786	Antonio 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/ajt.15905	Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, AOR San Carlo, San Carlo Hospital, Potenza, Italy|Department of Infectious Diseases, AORN dei Colli, Cotugno Hospital, Napoli, Italy|Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, AOR San Carlo, San Carlo Hospital, Potenza, Italy|Department of Infectious Diseases, AORN dei Colli, Cotugno Hospital, Napoli, Italy	('Italy', 4)
Social media for rapid knowledge dissemination: early experience from the COVID-19 pandemic	Chan, A. K. M.; Nickson, C. P.; Rudolph, J. W.; Lee, A.; Joynt, G. M.	Abstract The current COVID-19 pandemic is threatening global health. Rates of infection outside of China are rapidly increasing, with confirmed cases reported in over 160 countries as of 19 March 2020 [1]. During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, 21% of the global cumulative case total were healthcare workers [2], while a recent study from Wuhan, China reported that 1716 healthcare workers were infected with COVID-19, representing 3.8% of confirmed cases [3]. During the SARS epidemic, it is likely that a lack of awareness and preparedness put healthcare workers at risk [4]. Thus, delivering rapid, reliable information that addresses critical infection control issues is of key importance, and tracheal intubation is known to be associated with a high-risk of transmission of viral infections to healthcare workers [5, 6].	2020	NA	Anaesthesia	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/anae.15057	19184	#19729	Chan 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Ethics, social science, economics; Infection prevention and control	10.1111/anae.15057	Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong|Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong|Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong|Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong|Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong|Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong	NA

What we do when a COVID-19 patient needs an operation: operating room preparation and guidance	Ti, Lian Kah; Ang, Lin Stella; Foong, Theng Wai; Ng, Bryan Su Wei	We read with interest the recent review in the Journal by Wax and Christian1 on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The first case of COVID-19 in Singapore was confirmed on 23 January 2020.2 In the week of February 13â€“19, the World Health Organization reported that Singapore had more cases of COVID-19 than any other country outside of mainland China.3 We wish to share the protocol that we use in our hospital in preparing an operating room (OR) for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients coming for surgery. An OR with a negative pressure environment located at a corner of the operating complex, and with a separate access, is designated for all confirmed (or suspected) COVID-19 cases. The OR actually consists of five interconnected rooms, of which only the ante room and anesthesia induction rooms have negative atmospheric pressures. The OR proper, preparation, and scrub rooms all have positive pressures (eFig. 1 in the Electronic Supplementary Material [ESM]). Understanding the airflow within the OR is crucial to minimizing the risk of infection. The same OR and the same anesthesia machine will only be used for COVID-19 cases for the duration of the epidemic. An additional heat and moisture exchanger (HME) filter is placed on the expiratory limb of the circuit. Both HME filters and the soda lime are changed after each case. The anesthetic drug trolley is kept in the induction room. Before the start of each operation, the anesthesiologist puts all the drugs and equipment required for the procedure onto a tray to avoid handling of the drug trolley during the case. Nevertheless, if there is a need for additional drugs, hand hygiene and glove changing are performed before entering the induction room and handling the drug trolley.SN - 1496-8975	2020	NA	Canadian Journal of Anesthesia/Journal canadien d'anesthÃ©sie	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s12630-020-01617-4	5775	#5491	Ti 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1007/s12630-020-01617-4	Department of Anaesthesia, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore|Department of Anaesthesia, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore	('Singapore', 5)
Use of in situ simulation to evaluate the operational readiness of a high consequence infectious disease intensive care unit	Fregene, T. E.; Nadarajah, P.; Buckley, J. F.; Bigham, S.; Nangalia, V.	On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak of a coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The WHO guidance states that patients with COVID-19 should be managed by staff wearing appropriate personal protective equipment; however, working whilst wearing personal protective equipment is unfamiliar to many healthcare professionals. We ran high-fidelity, in situ simulation of high-risk procedures on patients with COVID-19 in a negative-pressure side room on our intensive care unit. Our aim was to identify potential problems, to test the robustness of our systems and to inform modification of our standard operating procedures for any patients with COVID-19 admitted to our intensive care unit. The simulations revealed several important latent risks and allowed us to put corrective measures in place prior to the admission of patients with COVID-19. We recommend that staff working in clinical areas expected to receive patients with COVID-19 conduct in situ simulation in order to detect their own unique risks and aid in the creation of local guidelines of management of patients with COVID-19.	2020	NA	Anaesthesia	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/anae.15048	17799	#18108	Fregene 2020	NA	* Comparative study, RCT; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/anae.15048	Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK|Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK|Department of Intensive Care, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK|Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK|Department of Intensive Care, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK|Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK|Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK|Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK|Department of Intensive Care, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK|Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK|Department of Intensive Care, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK|Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK|Instituted a ‚Äògrab‚Äêbox‚Äô of standardised tracheal intubation drugs which is kept in a nearby fridge and checked on a daily basis	('UK', 12)

Hospital surge capacity in a tertiaryÂ emergency referralÂ centre during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy	Carenzo, L.; Costantini, E.; Greco, M.; Barra, F. L.; Rendiniello, V.; Mainetti, M.; Bui, R.; Zanella, A.; Grasselli, G.; Lagioia, M.; Protti, A.; Cecconi, M.	Summary The first person-to-person transmission of the 2019-novel coronavirus in Italy on 21 February 2020 led to an infection chain that represents one of the largest known COVID-19 outbreaks outside Asia. In Northern Italy in particular, we rapidly experienced a critical care crisis due to a shortage of intensive care beds, as we expected according to data reported in China. Based on our experience of managing this surge, we produced this review to support other healthcare services in preparedness and training of hospitals during the current coronavirus outbreak. We had a dedicated task force that identified a response plan, which included: (1) establishment of dedicated, cohorted intensive care unit(s) (ICU) for COVID-19-positive patients; (2) design of appropriate procedures for pre-triage, diagnosis and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases; and (3) training of all staff to work in the dedicated ICU in personal protective equipment use and patient management. Hospital multidisciplinary and departmental collaboration was needed to work on all principles of surge capacity, including: space definition; supplies provision; staff recruitment; and ad-hoc training. Dedicated protocols were applied where full isolation of spaces, staff and patients was implemented. Opening the unit and the whole hospital emergency process required a multidisciplinary, multilevel involvement of healthcare providers and hospital managers all working towards a common goal: patient care and hospital safety. Hospitals should be prepared to face severe disruptions to their routine and it is very likely that protocols and procedures might require re-discussion and update on a daily basis.	2020	NA	Anaesthesia	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/anae.15072	31082	#30792	Carenzo 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/anae.15072	Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Emergency, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda ‚Äê Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy|Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, University of Milan, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Emergency, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda ‚Äê Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy|Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, University of Milan, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Emergency, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda ‚Äê Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy|Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, University of Milan, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Emergency, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda ‚Äê Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy|Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, University of Milan, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy|Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy	('Italy', 30)

Caring for patients with pain during the COVID-19 pandemic:Â Consensus recommendations from an international expert panel	Shanthanna, H.; Strand, N. H.; Provenzano, D. A.; Lobo, C. A.; Eldabe, S.; Bhatia, A.; Wegener, J.; Curtis, K.; Cohen, S. P.; Narouze, S.	Chronic pain causes significant suffering, limitation of daily activities and reduced quality of life. Infection from COVID-19 is responsible for an ongoing pandemic that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, leading to systemic complications and death. Led by the World Health Organization, healthcare systems across the world are engaged in limiting the spread of infection. As a result all elective surgeries, procedures, and patient visits, including pain management services, have been postponed or cancelled. This has impacted the care of chronic pain patients. Most are elderly with multiple comorbidities, which puts them at risk of COVID-19 infection. Important considerations that need to be recognised during this pandemic for chronic pain patients include: ensuring continuity of care and pain medications, especially opioids; use of telemedicine; maintaining biopsychosocial management; use of anti-inflammatory drugs; use of steroids; and prioritising necessary procedural visits. There are no guidelines to inform physicians and healthcare providers engaged in caring for patients with pain during this period of crisis. We assembled an expert panel of pain physicians, psychologists and researchers from North America and Europe to formulate recommendations to guide practice. As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve rapidly, these recommendations are based on the best available evidence and expert opinion at this present time and may need adapting to local workplace policies.	2020	NA	Anaesthesia	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/anae.15076	37870	#38784	Shanthanna 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/anae.15076	Department of Anesthesia, McMaster University, Toronto, ON, Canada|Department of Anaesthesiology, Hospital das For√ßas Armadas, P√≥lo Porto, Portugal|Department of Pain Medicine, The James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, UK|Department of Anesthesiology, Sint Maartenskliniek, Nijmegen, The Netherlands|Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Neurology and Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA|Department of Anesthesia, McMaster University, Toronto, ON, Canada|Department of Anaesthesiology, Hospital das For√ßas Armadas, P√≥lo Porto, Portugal|Department of Pain Medicine, The James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, UK|Department of Anesthesiology, Sint Maartenskliniek, Nijmegen, The Netherlands|Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Neurology and Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA	('Canada', 2)|('Portugal', 2)|('UK', 2)|('Netherlands', 2)|('USA', 2)
Special considerations for the management of COVID-19 pediatric patients in the operating room and pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary hospital in Singapore	Thampi, Swapna; Yap, Andrea; Lijia, Fan; Ong, Jacqueline	COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China and is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV 2. It has now spread rapidly to over 190 countries and territories around the world and has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. The virus is spread through droplet transmission and currently has a mortality rate of over 4% globally. The pediatric population has been found to be less susceptible to the disease with the majority of children having milder symptoms and only one pediatric death being reported globally so far. Despite this, strategies need to be put in place to prevent further spread of the virus.

Emergency cesarean section on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) confirmed patient	Lee, Dong Hwan; Lee, Jihyang; Kim, Eunju; Woo, Kyeongyoon; Park, Hak Youle; An, Jihyun	BACKGROUND: Since the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan in December 2019, the virus has spread globally. The World Health Organization declared the virus outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old woman who returned from China was confirmed as the first SARS-CoV-2 infected case in Korea. Since then, it has spread all over Korea. CASE: We report the first case of a SARS-CoV-2 positive woman delivering a baby through cesarean section at 37+6 weeks of pregnancy in the Republic of Korea. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggested that negative pressure operating room, skillful medical team, and enhanced personal protective equipment including N95 masks, surgical cap, double gown, double gloves, shoe covers, and powered air-purifying respirator are required at the hospital for safe delivery in such a case.	2020	NA	Korean journal of anesthesiology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.4097/kja.20116	25962	#23689	Lee 2020	NA	NA	10.4097/kja.20116	Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Daegu Fatimal Hospital, 99 Ayang-ro, Daegu 41199, Korea|Department of Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Daegu Fatima Hospital, 99 Ayang-ro, Daegu 41199, Korea	NA
Pulmonary High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) Findings of Patients with Early-Stage Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hangzhou, China	Gao, Lulu; Zhang, Jianjun	BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the imaging manifestations of early-stage coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to provide imaging basis for early detection of suspected cases and stratified intervention. MATERIAL AND METHODS From 20 January 2020 to 2 February 2020, 6 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 1 male and 5 females, were retrospectively reviewed in Zhejiang Hospital. These cases were clinically assessed and classified as common COVID-19. All patients underwent thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) within 2 days after the onset of symptoms, and their images were viewed by 2 radiologists who were blind to their clinical records. RESULTS CT images of 6 confirmed patients were collected. Two of the 6 patients (33.3%) had bilateral lung involvements and 4 (66.7%) had single-lung involvement. Two cases (33.3%) had a single lesion, 2 cases (33.3%) had 2 lesions, and 2 cases (33.3%) had multiple lesions. There were 2 cases (33.3%) with focal subpleural distribution and 1 case (16.7%) along the bronchial vascular bundle. Five cases (83.3%) had ground-glass opacities, 4 cases (66.7%) had ground-glass nodules, 1 case (16.7%) had thickened lobular septum, 2 cases (33.3%) had thickened bronchial wall, 2 cases (33.3%) had halo sign,1 case (16.7%) had crazy-paving sign, and 1 case (16.7%) had tree-in-bud sign. CONCLUSIONS The imaging manifestations of early-stage COVID-19 are relatively mild, and the imaging findings of some patients are not typical, which can easily lead to missed diagnoses. Thus, suspected cases need to be closely monitored, and epidemiological history and clinical laboratory examination should also be considered during diagnosis.	2020	NA	Med Sci Monit	NA	NA	NA	32246819	10.12659/MSM.923885	31272	#34285	Gao 2020	NA	NA	10.12659/MSM.923885	Department of Anesthesiology, Children‚Äôs Hospital	NA
Recommendation about the perioperative prevention of infection to healthcare workers and the anesthesia management of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection	Huang, J.; Hu, Y.; Wang, J.; Wang, D.; Zhu, Z.; Hu, Z.; Jin, Z.; Lin, H.; Huang, W.; Shen, W.; Jiang, Y.; Hu, M.; Wu, J.; Suo, Y.; Shu, Q.	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread widely and persistently over 100 countries. New challenges have occurred in the perioperative management of airway and anesthesia in children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to current publications and to our own experiences in anesthesia management for cases with SARS-CoV-2 suspected, we reviewed concerns about the perioperative prevention of SARS-CoV-2 to medical staff and the anesthesia strategy to the patient.	2020	NA	World Journal of Pediatric Surgery	3	1	NA	NA	10.1136/wjps-2020-000126	30302	#31714	Huang 2020	NA	NA	10.1136/wjps-2020-000126	Department of Anesthesiology, Children‚Äôs Hospital	NA
Review of the Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)	Jiang, Fang; Deng, Liehua; Zhang, Liangqing; Cai, Yin; Cheung, Chi Wai; Xia, Zhengyuan	In late December 2019, a cluster of cases with 2019 Novel Coronavirus pneumonia (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, aroused worldwide concern. Previous studies have reported epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this brief review is to summarize those published studies as of late February 2020 on the clinical features, symptoms, complications, and treatments of COVID-19 and help provide guidance for frontline medical staff in the clinical management of this outbreak.	2020	NA	Journal of General Internal Medicine	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s11606-020-05762-w	4883	#4546	Jiang 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Epidemiology	10.1007/s11606-020-05762-w	Department of Anesthesiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, SAR, China|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, China|Department of Anesthesiology, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, China	('China', 3)
To Protect Healthcare Workers Better, To Save More Lives	Chen, Weiyun; Huang, Yuguang	The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has thus far caused a total of 81,747 confirmed cases with 3,283 deaths in China, and more than 370,000 confirmed cases including over 16,000 deaths around the world by March 24, 2020. This issue has received extensive attention from the international community and has become a major public health priority. As the pandemic progresses, it is regrettable to know the healthcare workers, including anesthesiologists, being infected constantly. Therefore, we would like to share our firsthand practical experience and perspective in China, focusing on the personal protection of healthcare workers and the risk factors related to their infection, based on the different stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in China.

Safety and efficacy of different anesthetic regimens for parturients with COVID-19 undergoing Cesarean delivery: a case series of 17 patients	Chen, Rong; Zhang, Yuan; Huang, Lei; Cheng, Bi-heng; Xia, Zhong-yuan; Meng, Qing-tao	To assess the management and safety of epidural or general anesthesia for Cesarean delivery in parturients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and their newborns, and to evaluate the standardized procedures for protecting medical staff. We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19). Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated. We also recorded the patientsâ€™ demographic and clinicalÂ characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff. The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients. All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension. Three patients received general anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed. Three of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19. Three neonates were born prematurely. There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events. All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative. No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care period. Both epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia appeared excessive. Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from COVID-19.	2020	NA	Canadian Journal of Anesthesia/Journal canadien d'anesthÃ©sie	NA	NA	9-Jan	NA	10.1007/s12630-020-01630-7	8968	#8809	Chen 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s12630-020-01630-7	Department of Anesthesiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060, China|Department of Anesthesiology, East Hospital, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Obstetric, East Hospital, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China	('China', 3)

Obstetric Anesthesia During the COVID-19 Pandemic	Bauer, Melissa; Bernstein, Kyra; Dinges, Emily; Delgado, Carlos; El-Sharawi, Nadir; Sultan, Pervez; Mhyre, Jill M.; Landau, Ruth	With increasing numbers of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) cases due to efficient human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the United States, preparation for the unpredictable setting of labor and delivery is paramount. The priorities are two-fold in the management of obstetric patients with COVID-19 infection or persons under investigation (PUI): (1) caring for the range of asymptomatic to critically ill pregnant and postpartum women; (2) protecting health care workers and beyond from exposure during the delivery hospitalization (health care providers, personnel, family members). The goal of this review is to provide evidence-based recommendations, or expert opinion when evidence is limited, for anesthesiologists caring for pregnant women during the COVID 19 pandemic, with a focus on preparedness and best clinical obstetric anesthesia practice.

COVID-2019: the role of the nsp2 and nsp3 in its pathogenesis	Angeletti, Silvia; Benvenuto, Domenico; Bianchi, Martina; Giovanetti, Marta; Pascarella, Stefano; Ciccozzi, Massimo	Last December 2019, a new virus, named COVID-2019 causing many cases of severe pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China. The virus knowledge is limited and especially about COVID-2019 pathogenesis. The Open Reading Frame 1ab (ORF1ab) of COVID-2019 has been analyzed to evidence the presence of mutation caused by selective pressure on the virus. For selective pressure analysis fast-unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR) was used. Homology modelling has been performed by SwissModel and HHPred servers. The presence of transmembrane helical segments in Coronavirus ORF1ab nsp2 and nsp3, was tested by TMHMM, MEMSAT and MEMPACK tools. Three-dimensional structures have been analyzed and displayed using PyMOL. FUBAR analysis revealed the presence of potential sites under positive selective pressure (p-value < 0.05). Position 723 in the COVID-2019 has a serine instead a glycine residue, while at aminoacidic position 1010 a proline instead an isoleucine. Significant (p < 0.05) pervasive negative selection in 2416 sites (55%) was found. The positive selective pressure could account for some clinical features of this virus compared to SARS and Bat SARS-like CoV. The stabilizing mutation falling in the endosome-associated-protein-like domain of the nsp2 protein could account for COVID-2019 high ability of contagious, while the destabilizing mutation in nsp3 proteins could suggest a potential mechanism differentiating COVID-2019 from SARS. These data could be helpful for further investigation aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets or vaccine strategy, especially in the actual moment when the epidemic is ongoing and the scientific community is trying to enrich knowledge about this new viral pathogen.

Structural and biochemical characterization of SADS-CoV Papain Like protease 2	Wang, Lu; Hu, Weihua; Fan, Chengpeng	Abstract Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus that is involved in severe diarrhea disease in piglets, causing considerable agricultural and economic loss in China. The emergence of this new coronavirus increases the importance of understanding SADS-CoV as well as antivirals. Coronaviral proteases, including main proteases and papain-like proteases (PLP), are attractive antiviral targets because of their essential roles in polyprotein processing and thus virus maturation. Here, we describe the biochemical and structural identification of recombinant SADS papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain of nsp3. The SADS-CoV PLP2 was shown to cleave nsp1 proteins and also peptides mimicking the nsp2|nsp3 cleavage site and also had deubiquitinating and deISGynating activity by in vitro assay. The crystal structure adopts an architecture resembling that of PLPs from other coronaviruses. We characterize both conserved and unique structural features likely directing the interaction of PLP2 with the substrates, also including the tentative mapping of active site and other essential residues. These results provide a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of coronaviral PLPs's catalytic mechanism and for the screening and design of therapeutics to combat infection by SADS coronavirus.

Perhaps the most difficult is how to fairly distribute scarce resources, such as ICU beds and ventilators, as the answer will determine who lives and who dies. Compounding the difficulty, all of us are experiencing the dizzying newness of our socially distanced lives, and we sense that 'things are different now.'

Full-genome sequences of the first two SARS-CoV-2 viruses from India	Yadav, Pragya D.; Potdar, Varsha A.; Choudhary, Manohar Lal; Nyayanit, Dimpal A.; Agrawal, Megha; Jadhav, Santosh M.; Majumdar, Triparna D.; Shete-Aich, Anita; Basu, Atanu; Abraham, Priya; Cherian, Sarah S.	Background & objectives: : Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has globally affected 195 countries. In India, suspected cases were screened for SARS-CoV-2 as per the advisory of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The objective of this study was to characterize SARS-CoV-2 sequences from three identified positive cases as on February 29, 2020. Methods: : Throat swab/nasal swab specimens for a total of 881 suspected cases were screened by E gene and confirmed by RdRp (1), RdRp (2) and N gene real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions and next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis, molecular characterization and prediction of B- and T-cell epitopes for Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences were undertaken. Results: : Three cases with a travel history from Wuhan, China, were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. Almost complete (29,851 nucleotides) genomes of case 1, case 3 and a fragmented genome for case 2 were obtained. The sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 though not identical showed high (~99.98%) identity with Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (accession number: NC 045512). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Indian sequences belonged to different clusters. Predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be concentrated in the S1 domain of spike protein, and a conformational epitope was identified in the receptor-binding domain. The predicted T-cell epitopes showed broad human leucocyte antigen allele coverage of A and B supertypes predominant in the Indian population. Interpretation & conclusions: : The two SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from India represent two different introductions into the country. The genetic heterogeneity is as noted globally. The identified B- and T-cell epitopes may be considered suitable for future experiments towards the design of vaccines and diagnostics. Continuous monitoring and analysis of the sequences of new cases from India and the other affected countries would be vital to understand the genetic evolution and rates of substitution of the SARS-CoV-2.	2020	NA	Indian J Med Res	NA	NA	NA	32242873	10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_663_20	31450	#32582	Yadav 2020	NA	NA	10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_663_20	Department of Bioinformatics, ICMR-National Institute of Virology, 20-A, Dr Ambedkar Road, Pune 411 001, Maharashtra 	NA

Evidence of the COVID-19 Virus Targeting the CNS: Tissue Distribution, Hostâ€“Virus Interaction, and Proposed Neurotropic Mechanisms	Baig, Abdul Mannan; Khaleeq, Areeba; Ali, Usman; Syeda, Hira	The recent outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) has gripped the world with apprehension and has evoked a scare of epic proportion regarding its potential to spread and infect humans worldwide. As we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists are struggling to understand how it resembles and differs from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In a short time following the outbreak, it has been shown that, similar to SARS-CoV, COVID-19 virus exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the cells. This finding raises the curiosity of investigating the expression of ACE2 in neurological tissue and determining the possible contribution of neurological tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by COIVD-19. Here, we investigate the density of the expression levels of ACE2 in the CNS, the hostâ€“virus interaction and relate it to the pathogenesis and complications seen in the recent cases resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. Also, we debate the need for a model for staging COVID-19 based on neurological tissue involvement.	2020	NA	ACS Chemical Neuroscience	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00122	8843	#8344	Baig 2020	NA	Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00122	Department of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Aga Khan University, Karachi 74800, Pakistan|Department of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Aga Khan University, Karachi 74800, Pakistan|Department of Biosciences, Mohammad Ali Jinnah University, Karachi 75400, Pakistan|Institutional Sales	('Pakistan', 3)

Development of a Laboratory-safe and Low-cost Detection Protocol for SARS-CoV-2 of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)	Won, Joungha; Lee, Solji; Park, Myungsun; Kim, Tai Young; Park, Mingu Gordon; Choi, Byung Yoon; Kim, Dongwan; Chang, Hyeshik; Kim, V. Narry; Lee, C. Justin	The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly to over a dozen countries. Especially, the spike of case numbers in South Korea sparks pandemic worries. This virus is reported to spread mainly through personto- person contact via respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, or possibly through surface contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them. More critically, there have been reports about the possibility of this virus to transmit even before a virus-carrying person to show symptoms. Therefore, a low-cost, easy-access protocol for early detection of this virus is desperately needed. Here, we have established a real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rtPCR)-based assay protocol composed of easy specimen self-collection from a subject via pharyngeal swab, Trizolbased RNA purification, and SYBR Green-based rtPCR. This protocol shows an accuracy and sensitivity limit of 1-10 virus particles as we tested with a known lentivirus. The cost for each sample is estimated to be less than 15 US dollars. Overall time it takes for an entire protocol is estimated to be less than 4 hours. We propose a cost-effective, quick-and-easy method for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 at any conventional Biosafety Level II laboratories that are equipped with a rtPCR machine. Our newly developed protocol should be helpful for a first-hand screening of the asymptomatic virus-carriers for further prevention of transmission and early intervention and treatment for the rapidly propagating virus.	2020	NA	Exp Neurobiol	NA	NA	10.5607/en20009	32156101	10.5607/en20009	7421	#6809	Won 2020	NA	Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.5607/en20009	Department of Biological Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 34141, |Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam 13620, 	NA
2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outbreak and Molecular Genetic Characteristics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2	Jeong, Yong Seok	The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks that emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei province, have led to a formidable number of confirmed cases that resulted in >5,700 deaths globally, including 143 countries in all 6 continents. The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern with a very high level of global risk assessment. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent of COVID-19, has >79% nucleotide sequence homology to SARS-CoV; therefore, both belong to the genus betacoronavirus and subgenus sarbecovirus. The S1 domains of the two appeared to share the cellular receptor ACE2, but revealed a much higher S1-ACE2 binding affinity. As seen in many other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 also shows respiratory infection, but the basic reproductive number (Râ‚€) in transmission and the clinical latency are quite dissimilar from those of SARS- or MERS-CoVs. Many scientists infer that the time point of cross-barrier transfer from bats to mediate animals or to humans should be a rather recent event based on the full-length genome analyses obtained from the very first patients. Copy-choice polymerization, which often leads to a significant genome recombination rate in most coronaviruses, predicts the continued emergence of novel coronaviruses.	2020	NA	J Bacteriol Virol	50	1	8-Jan	NA	10.4167/jbv.2020.50.1.001	14383	#13564	Jeong 2020	NA	Epidemiology; Virology, immunology	10.4167/jbv.2020.50.1.001	Department of Biology, College of Sciences, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea.

Early Phylogenetic Estimate of the Effective Reproduction Number Of Sars-CoV-2	Lai, Alessia; Bergna, Annalisa; Acciarri, Carla; Galli, Massimo; Zehender, Gianguglielmo	To reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of the 2019 novel coronavirus recently causing an outbreak in Wuhan, China, 52 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available on 04 February 2020 at GISAID were analysed. The two models used to estimate the reproduction number (coalescent-based exponential growth and a birth-death skyline method) indicated an estimated mean evolutionary rate of 7.8 x 10(-4) subs/site/year (range 1.1x10(-4) -15x10(-4) ) and a mean tMRCA of the tree root of 73 days. The estimated R value was 2.6 (range 2.1-5.1), and increased from 0.8 to 2.4 in December 2019. The estimated mean doubling time of the epidemic was between 3.6 and 4.1 days. This study proves the usefulness of phylogeny in supporting the surveillance of emerging new infections even as the epidemic is growing. This article is protected by copyright.

Incubation period of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections among travellers from Wuhan, China, 20â€“28 January 2020	Backer, Jantien A; Klinkenberg, Don; Wallinga, Jacco	In January 2020, an increasing number of cases confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV were detected outside Wuhan. For 88 cases detected between 20 and 28 January, the travel history (to and) from Wuhan is known, as well as their symptom onset date. Their ages range from 2 to 72 years of age (information missing for four cases); 31 were female and 57 were male. During this initial stage of the epidemic, it is most likely that these travellers were infected in Wuhan. Consequently, their time spent in Wuhan can be taken as the duration of exposure to infection. Of these 88 cases with known travel history, 63 were Wuhan residents who travelled elsewhere and 25 were visitors who stayed in Wuhan for a limited time. By taking the date of symptom onset and travel history together, we inferred the possible incubation period for each of these cases. The data used for this analysis has been translated from Chinese sources such as provincial centres of disease control, and made publicly available [8]. We took the data as available on 29 January 2020 (Supplementary Material S1).	2020	NA	Eurosurveillance	25	5	2000062	NA	doi:https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000062	582	#668	Backer 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Awaiting classification; Epidemiology	doi:10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000062	Department of Biomedical Data Sciences, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands|Department of Error	('Netherlands', 1)
The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2	Gorbalenya, Alexander E.; Baker, Susan C.; Baric, Ralph S.; de Groot, Raoul J.; Drosten, Christian; Gulyaeva, Anastasia A.; Haagmans, Bart L.; Lauber, Chris; Leontovich, Andrey M.; Neuman, Benjamin W.; Penzar, Dmitry; Perlman, Stanley; Poon, Leo L. M.; Samborskiy, Dmitry V.; Sidorov, Igor A.; Sola, Isabel; Ziebuhr, John; Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of, Viruses	The present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic. The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/location/isolate/date. While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This will improve our understanding of virusâ€“host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.	2020	NA	Nature Microbiology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1038/s41564-020-0695-z	2614	#3173	Gorbalenya 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Epidemiology; Virology, immunology	10.1038/s41564-020-0695-z	Department of Biomedical Data Sciences, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands|Department of Medical Microbiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University of Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL, USA|Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA|Institute of Virology, Charit√© ‚Äì Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA|Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, National Center of Biotechnology (CNB-CSIC), Campus de Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain|Institute of Medical Virology, Justus Liebig University Giessen, Giessen, Germany	('USA', 3)|('Netherlands', 2)|('Germany', 2)|('Spain', 1)
COVID-19 outbreak and its monetary implications for dental practices, hospitals and healthcare workers	Farooq, Imran; Ali, Saqib	The novel COVID-19 came under limelight few months back (December 2019) and has recently been declared a pandemic by WHO. It has resulted in serious financial implications being faced by dental practices, hospitals and healthcare workers. Dental practice currently is restricted to provision of emergency dental care whereas, many hospitals have also cancelled elective procedures to save finances for COVID-19 treatment which is expensive and unpredictable. In addition, healthcare workers are also facing financial challenges in this difficult time. Competent authorities should step in to help dental practices, hospitals and healthcare workers in order to ensure the provision of all types of healthcare efficiently in these testing times and beyond.	2020	NA	Postgrad Med J	NA	NA	NA	32245754	10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-137781	31327	#34051	Farooq 2020	NA	NA	10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-137781	Department of Biomedical Dental Sciences|College of Dentistry, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University|Department of Finance Canada	('Canada', 1)

Chronology of COVID-19 cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship and ethical considerations: a report from Japan	Nakazawa, Eisuke; Ino, Hiroyasu; Akabayashi, Akira	Fact:The Diamond Princess cruise ship has been anchored at the Yokohama port in Japan since February 3, 2020. A total of 691 cases of COVID-19 infection had been confirmed as of February 23. The government initially assumed that the infection was not spreading aboard and therefore indicated that any persons who either tested negative for the virus or were asymptomatic should immediately disembark. However, on February 5, the government set a 14-day health observation period because of the severity of the infection. Passengers confirmed to free from infection began disembarking on Day 15 of quarantine (February 19).Facts to be examined:The effectiveness and validity of infection control, justification for the timing of inspections, and even the nature of COVID-19 itself are now all in question.Ethical considerations:The ethical considerations related to cruise ship infection control include the reasonable justification for isolation, the psychological fragility and quality of life of the isolated passengers and crew members, the procedural justice inherent in a forced quarantine, and the optimization of control measures.Public health preparedness:The international coordination framework and the global ramifications of such outbreaks should be reevaluated by the international community. Denying a ship's entry based on local politics is incompatible with global justice. Events such as these require an international response and global regulations that seek to reduce disparities.

Comparative Serological Study for the Prevalence of Anti-MERS Coronavirus Antibodies in High- and Low-Risk Groups in Qatar	Al Kahlout, Reham A.; Nasrallah, Gheyath K.; Farag, Elmoubasher A.; Wang, Lingshu; Lattwein, Erik; MÃ¼ller, Marcel A.; El Zowalaty, Mohamed E.; Al Romaihi, Hamad E.; Graham, Barney S.; Al Thani, Asmaa A.; Yassine, Hadi M.	Infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) could be asymptomatic or cause mild influenza-like illness. Therefore, the prevalence of MERS-CoV infections in the general population could be underestimated, which necessitates active surveillance to determine the epidemiological importance of asymptomatic cases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of various serological assays and to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in high- and low-risk groups in Qatar. A total of 4858 samples were screened, including 4719 samples collected from healthy blood donors (BD) over a period of five years (2012-2016), 135 samples from baseline case contacts (CC) collected from individuals in close contact with three positive PCR-confirmed patients (CP), and four samples from MERS-CoV CP. Initial screening using anti-MERS-CoV IgG (IgG rS1-ELISA kit) revealed ten reactive samples from BD (10/4719, 0.21%), one from CC (1/135, 0.74%), and three from CP (3/4, 75%). Samples from CP but not from BD were also reactive by whole-virus anti-MERS-CoV IgG (n = 3/4) and IgM (n = 1/4) indirect immunefluorescent tests (IIFT) and pseudoparticle neutralization test (ppNT). The reactive sample from CC was also confirmed by ppNT. Surprisingly, one out of thirteen (7.7%) randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA-negative BD samples from the initial screening was reactive by the IgM-IIFT (but not by the IgG-IIFT) and was subsequently confirmed by ppNT. All IgG rS1-ELISA-reactive samples from BD exhibited considerable reactivity to the four circulating human coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63). Cross-reactivity with SARS was only reported for samples from CP using IgG and IgM-IIFT. In conclusion, we report a low prevalence of anti-MERS antibodies in the general population, which coincides with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study (2017) in Qatar (n = 21). The false-positive results and the observed cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other circulating human coronavirus necessitate more detailed evaluation of available serological assays.	2019	NA	Journal of Immunology Research	NA	NA	8-Jan	134769660.

From SARS and MERS CoVs to SARS-CoV-2: moving toward more biased codon usage in viral structural and non-structural genes	Kandeel, Mahmoud; Ibrahim, Abdel Azim; Fayez, Mahmoud; Al-Nazawi, Mohammed	BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging disease with fatal outcomes. In this study, a fundamental knowledge gap question is to be resolved by evaluating the differences in biological and pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with the two prior major COV epidemics, SARS and MERS coronaviruses. METHODS: The genome composition, nucleotides analysis, codon usage indices, relative synonymous codons usage (RESU) and effective number of codons (ENc) were analysed in the four structural genes; Spike (S), Envelope (E), membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes, and two of the most important non-structural genes comprising RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, Beta-CoV from pangolins, bat SARS, MERS and SARS CoVs. These genes include Spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), Envelop(E) and membrane (M) genes. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most high-frequency codons were ending with A or T, while the low frequency and rare codons were ending with G or C. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins showed 5-20 lower ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoVs. This implies higher codon bias and higher gene expression efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. SARS-CoV-2 encoded the highest number of over biased and negatively biased codons. Pangolin Beta-CoV showed little differences with SARS-CoV-2 ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoV. CONCLUSION: Extreme bias and lower ENc values of SARS-CoV-2, especially in Spike, Envelope and Mpro genes, are suggestive for higher gene expression efficiency, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoVs.

A high ATP concentration enhances the cooperative translocation of the SARS coronavirus helicase nsP13 in the unwinding of duplex RNA	Jang, Kyoung-Jin; Jeong, Seonghwan; Kang, Dong Young; Sp, Nipin; Yang, Young Mok; Kim, Dong-Eun	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nonstructural protein 13 (SCV nsP13), a superfamily 1 helicase, plays a central role in viral RNA replication through the unwinding of duplex RNA and DNA with a 5' single-stranded tail in a 5' to 3' direction. Despite its putative role in viral RNA replication, nsP13 readily unwinds duplex DNA by cooperative translocation. Herein, nsP13 exhibited different characteristics in duplex RNA unwinding than that in duplex DNA. nsP13 showed very poor processivity on duplex RNA compared with that on duplex DNA. More importantly, nsP13 inefficiently unwinds duplex RNA by increasing the 5'-ss tail length. As the concentration of nsP13 increased, the amount of unwound duplex DNA increased and that of unwound duplex RNA decreased. The accumulation of duplex RNA/nsP13 complexes increased as the concentration of nsP13 increased. An increased ATP concentration in the unwinding of duplex RNA relieved the decrease in duplex RNA unwinding. Thus, nsP13 has a strong affinity for duplex RNA as a substrate for the unwinding reaction, which requires increased ATPs to processively unwind duplex RNA. Our results suggest that duplex RNA is a preferred substrate for the helicase activity of nsP13 than duplex DNA at high ATP concentrations.	2020	NA	Scientific reports	10	1	4481-4481	NA	10.1038/s41598-020-61432-1	7937	#7753	Jang 2020	NA	Virology, immunology	10.1038/s41598-020-61432-1	Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Seoul, 05029, Republic of Korea|Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Institute of Biomedical Science and Technology (IBST), Konkuk University, Seoul, 05029, Republic of Korea	('uk', 2)
Impact of international travel and border control measures on the global spread of the novel 2019 coronavirus outbreak	Wells, Chad R.; Sah, Pratha; Moghadas, Seyed M.; Pandey, Abhishek; Shoukat, Affan; Wang, Yaning; Wang, Zheng; Meyers, Lauren A.; Singer, Burton H.; Galvani, Alison P.	The novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) in mainland China has rapidly spread across the globe. Within 2 mo since the outbreak was first reported on December 31, 2019, a total of 566 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV-2) cases have been confirmed in 26 other countries. Travel restrictions and border control measures have been enforced in China and other countries to limit the spread of the outbreak. We estimate the impact of these control measures and investigate the role of the airport travel network on the global spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results show that the daily risk of exporting at least a single SARS CoV-2 case from mainland China via international travel exceeded 95% on January 13, 2020. We found that 779 cases (95% CI: 632 to 967) would have been exported by February 15, 2020 without any border or travel restrictions and that the travel lockdowns enforced by the Chinese government averted 70.5% (95% CI: 68.8 to 72.0%) of these cases. In addition, during the first three and a half weeks of implementation, the travel restrictions decreased the daily rate of exportation by 81.3% (95% CI: 80.5 to 82.1%), on average. At this early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak, buying time to coordinate an appropriate public health response.	2020	NA	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	NA	NA	202002616-202002616	NA	10.1073/pnas.2002616117	8747	#8518	Wells 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Epidemiology	10.1073/pnas.2002616117	Department of Biostatistics, |Department of Integrative Biology, |University of Florida	NA
The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak	Chinazzi, M.; Davis, J. T.; Ajelli, M.; Gioannini, C.; Litvinova, M.; Merler, S.; Pastore, Y. Piontti A.; Mu, K.; Rossi, L.; Sun, K.; Viboud, C.; Xiong, X.; Yu, H.; Halloran, M. E.; Longini, I. M., Jr.; Vespignani, A.	Motivated by the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated based on internationally reported cases, and shows that at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers. The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in Mainland China, but has a more marked effect at the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.	2020	NA	Science (New York, N.Y.)

Immunoinformatics-aided identification of T cell and B cell epitopes in the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV	Baruah, Vargab; Bose, Sujoy	The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has caused a large number of deaths with thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, especially in East Asia. This study took an immunoinformatics approach to identify significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and B cell epitopes in the 2019-nCoV surface glycoprotein. Also, interactions between identified CTL epitopes and their corresponding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I supertype representatives prevalent in China were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We identified five CTL epitopes, three sequential B cell epitopes and five discontinuous B cell epitopes in the viral surface glycoprotein. Also, during simulations, the CTL epitopes were observed to be binding MHC class I peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts, with continuous hydrogen bonds and salt bridge anchors, indicating their potential in generating immune responses. Some of these identified epitopes can be potential candidates for the development of 2019-nCoV vaccines.	2020	NA	Journal of Medical Virology	92	5	495-500	WOS:000517679900001	10.1002/jmv.25698	10599	#10443	Baruah 2020	NA	Virology, immunology	10.1002/jmv.25698	Department of Biotechnology, Gauhati University, Guwahati, Assam, India|Department of Biotechnology, Gauhati University, Guwahati, Assam, India|Department of Biotechnology, Gauhati University, Guwahati, Assam, India|Department of Biotechnology, Gauhati University, Guwahati, Assam, India	('India', 4)

A numerical study of ventilation strategies for infection risk mitigation in general inpatient wards	Satheesan, Manoj Kumar; Mui, Kwok Wai; Wong, Ling Tim	Aerial dispersion of human exhaled microbial contaminants and subsequent contamination of surfaces is a potential route for infection transmission in hospitals. Most general hospital wards have ventilation systems that drive air and thus contaminants from the patient areas towards the corridors. This study investigates the transport mechanism and deposition patterns of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) within a typical six bedded general inpatient ward cubicle through numerical simulation. It demonstrates that both air change and exhaust airflow rates have significant effects on not only the airflow but also the particle distribution within a mechanically ventilated space. Moreover, the location of an infected patient within the ward cubicle is crucial in determining the extent of infection risk to other ward occupants. Hence, it is recommended to provide exhaust grilles in close proximity to a patient, preferably above each patientâ€™s bed. To achieve infection prevention and control, high exhaust airflow rate is also suggested. Regardless of the ventilation design, all patients and any surfaces within a ward cubicle should be regularly and thoroughly cleaned and disinfected to remove microbial contamination. The outcome of this study can serve as a source of reference for hospital management to better ventilation design strategies for mitigating the risk of infection.	2020	NA	Building Simulation	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s12273-020-0623-4	1070	#1937	Satheesan 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Infection prevention and control	10.1007/s12273-020-0623-4	Department of Building Services Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China	('China', 1)

Phase-adjusted estimation of the number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 cases in Wuhan, China	Wang, Huwen; Wang, Zezhou; Dong, Yinqiao; Chang, Ruijie; Xu, Chen; Yu, Xiaoyue; Zhang, Shuxian; Tsamlag, Lhakpa; Shang, Meili; Huang, Jinyan; Wang, Ying; Xu, Gang; Shen, Tian; Zhang, Xinxin; Cai, Yong	An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rtâ€‰=â€‰1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rtâ€‰=â€‰3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (Rtâ€‰=â€‰0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077â€“84,520 or 55,869â€“81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.	2020	NA	Cell Discovery	6	1	10	NA	10.1038/s41421-020-0148-0	1299	#1750	Wang 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.1038/s41421-020-0148-0	Department of Cancer Prevention, Shanghai Cancer Center, Fudan University, 200032, Shanghai, China|Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, 200032, Shanghai, China|Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, China Medical University, 110122, Shenyang, China	('China', 4)

Prevalence and impact of cardiovascular metabolic diseases on COVID-19 in China	Li, Bo; Yang, Jing; Zhao, Faming; Zhi, Lili; Wang, Xiqian; Liu, Lin; Bi, Zhaohui; Zhao, Yunhe	BACKGROUND: Studies have reminded that cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities made patients more susceptible to suffer 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19), and exacerbated the infection. The aim of this analysis is to determine the association of cardiovascular metabolic diseases with the development of COVID-19. METHODS: A meta-analysis of eligible studies that summarized the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in COVID-19 and compared the incidences of the comorbidities in ICU/severe and non-ICU/severe patients was performed. Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. RESULTS: A total of six studies with 1527 patients were included in this analysis. The proportions of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascularÂ disease and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1%, 16.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The incidences of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds, threefolds and twofolds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts. At least 8.0% patients with COVID-19 suffered the acute cardiac injury. The incidence of acute cardiac injury was about 13 folds higher in ICU/severe patients compared with the non-ICU/severe patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of developing into the severe condition and the comorbidities can also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 can, in turn, aggravate the damage to the heart.	2020	NA	Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society	NA	NA	10.1007/s00392-020-01626-9	NA	10.1007/s00392-020-01626-9	7927	#7790	Li 2020	NA	* Systematic review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s00392-020-01626-9	Department of Cardiology, Zibo Central Hospital, Shandong University, No. 10, Sonth Shanghai Road, Zibo, 255000, People‚Äôs Republic of China|Department of Infectious Diseases, No. 4 Hospital of Zibo, No. 210, Shan Quan Road, Zibo, 255000, People‚Äôs Republic of China|Department of Allergy, Zibo Central Hospital, Shandong University, No. 10, Sonth Shanghai Road, Zibo, 255000, People‚Äôs Republic of China	('China', 3)

A new strain of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) was identified and caused the first pandemic of the 21st century. The virus was officially detected in our country on March 11, 2020, and the number of cases increased rapidly; the virus was isolated in 670 patients within 10 days. The rapid increase in the number of patients has required our physicians to learn to protect both the public and themselves when treating patients with this highly infectious disease. The group most affected by the outbreak and with the highest mortality rate is elderly patients with known cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is necessary for cardiology specialists to take an active role in combating the epidemic. The aim of this article is to make a brief assessment of current information regarding the management of cardiovascular patients affected by COVID-19 and to provide practical suggestions to cardiology specialists about problems and questions they have frequently encountered.	2020	NA	Turk Kardiyol Dern Ars	NA	NA	NA	32250347	10.5543/tkda.2020.97198	41597	#39039	Aktoz 2020	NA	NA	10.5543/tkda.2020.97198	Department of Cardiology,Trakya University Faculty of Medicine, Edirne|Department of Cardiology, Ba≈ükent University Istanbul Hospital, Health Practice and Research Center, ƒ∞stanbul|Department of Cardiology, Yeditepe University School of Medicine, ƒ∞stanbul|Department of Cardiology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara|Department of Cardiology, Ko√ß University Faculty of Medicine, ƒ∞stanbul|Department of Cardiology, Adana Middle East Hospital, Adana|Department of Cardiology, University of Health Sciences, G√ºlhane Training and Research Hospital, Ankara|Department of Cardiology, Dokuz Eyl√ºl University Faculty of Medicine, ƒ∞zmir|Department of Cardiology, Ankara City Hospital, Ankara|Department of Cardiology, Department of Cardiology, Eski≈üehir Osmangazi University Hospital, Eski≈üehir|Department of Cardiology, Mersin University Faculty of Medicine, Mersin|Department of Cardiology, Yeditepe University Hospital, ƒ∞stanbul|Department of Infectious Diseases, Ko√ß University Faculty of Medicine, ƒ∞stanbul|University of Health Sciences, Mehmet Akif Ersoy Chest Cardiovascular Surgery Training and Research Hospital, ƒ∞stanbul|Department of Cardiology, ≈ûi≈üli Kolan International, ƒ∞stanbul|Department of Cardiology, ƒ∞zmir Katip √áelebi University Atat√ºrk Training and Research Hospital, ƒ∞zmir|Department of Cardiology, Kartal Ko≈üuyolu Y√ºksek ƒ∞htisas Training and Research Hospital, ƒ∞stanbul|Department of Cardiology, Fƒ±rat University Faculty of Medicine, Elazƒ±ƒü|Department of Cardiology, Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital, ƒ∞zmir|Department of Cardiology, ƒ∞stanbul Sultan Abd√ºlhamid Han Training and Research Hospital, ƒ∞stanbul|Department of Cardiology, Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine, Kocaeli|Department of Cardiology, ƒ∞stanbul University Cardiology Institute, ƒ∞stanbul|Department of Cardiology, Marmara University Faculty of Medicine, ƒ∞stanbul|Department of Cardiology, ƒ∞stanbul Baƒücƒ±lar Training and Research Hospital, ƒ∞stanbul|Department of Cardiology, Ba≈ükent University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara|Department of Cardiology, Kocaeli Derince Training and Research Hospital, Kocaeli|Department of Cardiology, Sakarya University Faculty of Medicine, Sakarya|Department of Cardiology, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara	NA

The entire healthcare system had to respond promptly in a very short time to an exponential growth of the number of subjects affected by COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) with the need of semi-intensive and intensive care units.	2020	NA	Monaldi Arch Chest Dis	NA	NA	NA	32236089	10.4081/monaldi.2020.1285	31716	#33646	Lazzeri 2020	NA	NA	10.4081/monaldi.2020.1285	Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan|Department of Neuroscience, Sleep Medicine Center, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan|Department of Rehabilitation, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona	NA
The origin, transmission and clinical therapies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak â€“ an update on the status	Guo, Yan-Rong; Cao, Qing-Dong; Hong, Zhong-Si; Tan, Yuan-Yang; Chen, Shou-Deng; Jin, Hong-Jun; Tan, Kai-Sen; Wang, De-Yun; Yan, Yan	An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention. On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to Î²-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.	2020	NA	Military Medical Research	7	1	11-Nov	NA	10.1186/s40779-020-00240-0	8836	#8393	Guo 2020	NA	* Normative guidance; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology	10.1186/s40779-020-00240-0	Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China|Department of Otolaryngology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore, 119228, Singapore	('Singapore', 3)|('China', 1)
The effectiveness of the quarantine of Wuhan city against the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): well-mixed SEIR model analysis	Hou, Can; Chen, Jiaxin; Zhou, Yaqing; Hua, Lei; Yuan, Jinxia; He, Shu; Guo, Yi; Zhang, Sheng; Jia, Qiaowei; Zhao, Chenhui; Zhang, Jing; Xu, Guangxu; Jia, Enzhi	Abstract Background A novel coronavirus pneumonia, first identified in Wuhan City and referred to as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, has been quickly spreading to other cities and countries. To control the epidemic, the Chinese government mandated a quarantine of the Wuhan city on January 23, 2020. To explore the effectiveness of the quarantine of the Wuhan city against this epidemic, transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have been estimated. Methods A well-mixed ?susceptible exposed infectious recovered? (SEIR) compartmental model was employed to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic based on epidemiological characteristics of individuals, clinical progression of COVID-19, and quarantine intervention measures of the authority. Results Considering infected individuals as contagious during the latency period, the well-mixed SEIR model fitting results based on the assumed contact rate of latent individuals are within 6?18, which represented the possible impact of quarantine and isolation interventions on disease infections, whereas other parameter were suppose as unchanged under the current intervention. Conclusion The present study shows that, by reducing the contact rate of latent individuals, interventions such as quarantine and isolation can effectively reduce the potential peak number of COVID-19 infections and delay the time of peak infection.

Elevated plasmin(ogen) as a common risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility	Ji, Hong-Long; Zhao, Runzhen; Matalon, Sadis; Matthay, Michael A.	Patients with hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular illness, COPD, and kidney dysfunction have worse clinical outcomes when infected with SARS-CoV-2, for unknown reasons. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence for the existence of elevated plasmin(ogen) in COVID-19 patients with these comorbid conditions. Plasmin, and other proteases, may cleave a newly inserted furin site in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, extracellularly, which increases its infectivity and virulence. Hyper-fibrinolysis associated with plasmin leads to elevated D-dimer in severe patients. The plasmin(ogen) system may prove a promising therapeutic target for combating COVID-19.	2020	NA	Physiological reviews	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1152/physrev.00013.2020	17721	#17758	Ji 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1152/physrev.00013.2020	Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Health Science Centre at Tyler, Tyler, Texas; Texas Lung Injury Institute, University of Texas Health Science Centre at Tyler, Tyler, Texas; Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Division of Molecular and Translational Biomedicine, Pulmonary Injury and Repair Center, School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama; and Department of Medicine and Anesthesia, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California|Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Health Science Centre at Tyler, Tyler, Texas; Texas Lung Injury Institute, University of Texas Health Science Centre at Tyler, Tyler, Texas; Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Division of Molecular and Translational Biomedicine, Pulmonary Injury and Repair Center, School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama; and Department of Medicine and Anesthesia, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California|Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Health Science Centre at Tyler, Tyler, Texas; Texas Lung Injury Institute, University of Texas Health Science Centre at Tyler, Tyler, Texas; Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Division of Molecular and Translational Biomedicine, Pulmonary Injury and Repair Center, School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama; and Department of Medicine and Anesthesia, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California|Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Health Science Centre at Tyler, Tyler, Texas; Texas Lung Injury Institute, University of Texas Health Science Centre at Tyler, Tyler, Texas; Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Division of Molecular and Translational Biomedicine, Pulmonary Injury and Repair Center, School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama; and Department of Medicine and Anesthesia, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California	NA
Autopsy in suspected COVID-19 cases	Hanley, B.; Lucas, S. B.; Youd, E.; Swift, B.; Osborn, M.	The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus-2 (CoV-2) outbreak in Wuhan, China, has now spread to many countries across the world including the UK with over 3000 deaths as of early March 2020. This will inevitably lead to an increase in the number of suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related deaths at autopsy. The Royal College of Pathologists has responded to this concern with the release of guidelines on autopsy practice relating to COVID-19. The following article is a summary and interpretation of these guidelines. It includes a description of hazard group 3 organisms to which SARS-CoV-2 has been assigned, a brief description of what is currently known about the pathological and autopsy findings in COVID-19, a summary of the recommendations for conducting autopsies in suspected COVID-19 cases and the techniques for making the diagnosis at autopsy. It concludes by considering the clinicopathological correlation and notification of such cases.	2020	NA	Journal of clinical pathology	NA	NA	NA	32198191	10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206522	12214	#11426	Hanley 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Epidemiology	10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206522	Department of Cellular Pathology|Department of Histopathology|Department of Histopathology	NA

Structural, glycosylation and antigenic variation between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)	Kumar, Swatantra; Maurya, Vimal K.; Prasad, Anil K.; Bhatt, Madan L. B.; Saxena, Shailendra K.	The emergence of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is of global concern and might have emerged from RNA recombination among existing coronaviruses. CoV spike (S) protein which is crucial for receptor binding, membrane fusion via conformational changes, internalization of the virus, host tissue tropism and comprises crucial targets for vaccine development, remain largely uncharacterized. Therefore, the present study has been planned to determine the sequence variation, structural and antigenic divergence of S glycoprotein which may be helpful for the management of 2019-nCoV infection. The sequences of spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were used for the comparison. The sequence variations were determined using EMBOSS Needle pairwise sequence alignment tools. The variation in glycosylation sites was predicted by NetNGlyc 1.0 and validated by N-GlyDE server. Antigenicity was predicted by NetCTL 1.2 and validated by IEDB Analysis Resource server. The structural divergence was determined by using SuperPose Version 1.0 based on cryo-EM structure of the SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein. Our data suggests that 2019-nCoV is newly spilled coronavirus into humans in China is closely related to SARS-CoV, which has only 12.8% of difference with SARS-CoV in S protein and has 83.9% similarity in minimal receptor-binding domain with SARS-CoV. Addition of a novel glycosylation sites were observed in 2019-nCoV. In addition, antigenic analysis proposes that great antigenic differences exist between both the viral strains, but some of the epitopes were found to be similar between both the S proteins. In spite of the variation in S protein amino acid composition, we found no significant difference in their structures. Collectively, for the first time our results exhibit the emergence of human 2019-nCoV is closely related to predecessor SARS-CoV and provide the evidence that 2019-nCoV uses various novel glycosylation sites as SARS-CoV and may have a potential to become pandemic owing its antigenic discrepancy. Further, demonstration of novel Cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes may impart opportunities for the development of peptide based vaccine for the prevention of 2019-nCoV.	2020	NA	VirusDisease	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s13337-020-00571-5	4881	#4531	Kumar 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Virology, immunology	10.1007/s13337-020-00571-5	Department of Centre for Advanced Research (CFAR), Faculty of Medicine, King George‚Äôs Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow, 226003, India	('uckn', 1)|('India', 1)

Reactive Polymer Targeting dsRNA as Universal Virus Detection Platform with Enhanced Sensitivity	Ku, Jayoung; Kim, Sura; Park, Jaemin; Kim, Tae-Shin; Kharbash, Raisa; Shin, Eui-Cheol; Char, Kookheon; Kim, Yoosik; Li, Sheng	Reactive poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate) (PPFPA) grafted surfaces offer a versatile platform to immobilize biomolecules. Here, we utilize PPFPA grafted surface and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) recognizing J2 antibody to construct a universal virus detection platform with enhanced sensitivity. PPFPA on silicon substrates are prepared, and surface hydrophilicity is modulated by partial substitution of the pentafluorophenyl units with poly(ethylene glycol). Following dsRNA antibody immobilization, the prepared surfaces can distinguish long dsRNAs from single-stranded RNAs of the same length and short dsRNAs. As long dsRNAs are common byproducts of viral transcription/replication, these surfaces can detect the presence of different kinds of viruses without prior knowledge of their genomic sequences. To increase dsRNA detection sensitivity, a two-step method is devised where the captured dsRNAs are visualized with multiple fluorophore-tagged J2 antibodies. We show that the developed platform can differentiate foreign long dsRNAs from cellular dsRNAs and other biomolecules present in the cell lysate. Moreover, when tested against cells infected with hepatitis A or C viruses, both viruses are successfully detected using a single platform. Our study shows that the developed PPFPA platform immobilized with J2 antibody can serve as a primary diagnostic tool to determine the infection status for a wide range of viruses.	2020	NA	Biomacromolecules	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1021/acs.biomac.0c00379	26303	#23562	Ku 2020	NA	NA	10.1021/acs.biomac.0c00379	Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 34141 South Korea|Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 34141 South Korea|Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 34141 South Korea|Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 34141 South Korea|Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 34141 South Korea|Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 34141 South Korea|Institutional Sales	('South Korea', 6)

Antivirals in medical biodefense	Bugert, J. J.; Hucke, F.; Zanetta, P.; Bassetto, M.; Brancale, A.	The viruses historically implicated or currently considered as candidates for misuse in bioterrorist events are poxviruses, filoviruses, bunyaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses and a number of arboviruses causing encephalitis, including alpha- and flaviviruses. All these viruses are of concern for public health services when they occur in natural outbreaks or emerge in unvaccinated populations. Recent events and intelligence reports point to a growing risk of dangerous biological agents being used for nefarious purposes. Public health responses effective in natural outbreaks of infectious disease may not be sufficient to deal with the severe consequences of a deliberate release of such agents. One important aspect of countermeasures against viral biothreat agents are the antiviral treatment options available for use in post-exposure prophylaxis. These issues were adressed by the organizers of the 16th Medical Biodefense Conference, held in Munich in 2018, in a special session on the development of drugs to treat infections with viruses currently perceived as a threat to societies or associated with a potential for misuse as biothreat agents. This review will outline the state-of-the-art methods in antivirals research discussed and provide an overview of antiviral compounds in the pipeline that are already approved for use or still under development.	2020	NA	Virus Genes	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s11262-020-01737-5	67	#1327	Bugert 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Other related diseases and viruses; Virology, immunology	10.1007/s11262-020-01737-5	Department of Chemistry, Swansea University, Swansea, SA2 8PP, UK	('UK', 1)
Investigation into SARS-CoV-2 Resistance of Compounds in Garlic Essential Oil	Thuy, Bui Thi Phuong; My, Tran Thi Ai; Hai, Nguyen Thi Thanh; Hieu, Le Trung; Hoa, Tran Thai; Thi Phuong Loan, Huynh; Triet, Nguyen Thanh; Anh, Tran Thi Van; Quy, Phan Tu; Tat, Pham Van; Hue, Nguyen Van; Quang, Duong Tuan; Trung, Nguyen Tien; Tung, Vo Thanh; Huynh, Lam K.; Nhung, Nguyen Thi Ai	Eighteen active substances, including 17 organosulfur compounds found in garlic essential oil (T), were identified by GCâ€“MS analysis. For the first time, using the molecular docking technique, we report the inhibitory effect of the considered compounds on the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein in the human body that leads to a crucial foundation about coronavirus resistance of individual compounds on the main protease (PDB6LU7) protein of SARS-CoV-2. The results show that the 17 organosulfur compounds, accounting for 99.4% contents of the garlic essential oil, have strong interactions with the amino acids of the ACE2 protein and the main protease PDB6LU7 of SARS-CoV-2. The strongest anticoronavirus activity is expressed in allyl disulfide and allyl trisulfide, which account for the highest content in the garlic essential oil (51.3%). Interestingly, docking results indicate the synergistic interactions of the 17 substances, which exhibit good inhibition of the ACE2 and PDB6LU7 proteins. The results suggest that the garlic essential oil is a valuable natural antivirus source, which contributes to preventing the invasion of coronavirus into the human body.	2020	NA	ACS Omega	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1021/acsomega.0c00772	21148	#20895	Thuy 2020	NA	NA	10.1021/acsomega.0c00772	Department of Chemistry, University of Sciences, Hue University, 77 Nguyen Hue Street, Hue City 530000, Vietnam|Department of Chemistry, University of Sciences, Hue University, 77 Nguyen Hue Street, Hue City 530000, Vietnam|Department of Chemistry, University of Sciences, Hue University, 77 Nguyen Hue Street, Hue City 530000, Vietnam|Department of Chemistry, University of Sciences, Hue University, 77 Nguyen Hue Street, Hue City 530000, Vietnam|Department of Chemistry, University of Sciences, Hue University, 77 Nguyen Hue Street, Hue City 530000, Vietnam|Department of Natural Sciences & Technology, Tay Nguyen University, 567 L√™ Duan Street, Buon Ma Thuot City 630000, Vietnam|Department of Environmental Engineering, Hoa Sen University, 93 Cao Thang Street, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam|Department of Chemistry, University of Education, Hue University, 34 Le loi, Hue City 530000, Vietnam|University of Sciences, Hue University, 77 Nguyen Hue Street, Hue City 530000, Vietnam|Department of Chemical Engineering, International University, Quarter 6, Linh Trung Ward, Thu Duc District, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam|Department of Chemistry, University of Sciences, Hue University, 77 Nguyen Hue Street, Hue City 530000, Vietnam|Institutional Sales	('Vietnam', 11)
Clinical Features and Treatment of COVID-19 Patients in Northeast Chongqing	Wan, S.; Xiang, Y.; Fang, W.; Zheng, Y.; Li, B.; Hu, Y.; Lang, C.; Huang, D.; Sun, Q.; Xiong, Y.; Huang, X.; Lv, J.; Luo, Y.; Shen, L.; Yang, H.; Huang, G.; Yang, R.	BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (SARS CoV-2) that began in December 2019 presents a significant and urgent threat to global health. This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study. RESULTS: A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (IQR 36-55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3% men). The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area. Forty-three (31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]). Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]). Chest CT scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all of the patients. All of the patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%] (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]). In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (124 [91.8%]). It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of western and Chinese medicine. Compared with the mild cases, the severe cases had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, D-dimer, LDH, PCT, ALB, CRP, and AST. CONCLUSION: In this study, the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID-19 patients were demonstrated. Kaletra and traditional Chinese medicine played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia. Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

Diagnostic Utility of Clinical Laboratory Data Determinations for Patients with the Severe COVID-19	Gao, Yong; Li, Tuantuan; Han, Mingfeng; Li, Xiuyong; Wu, Dong; Xu, Yuanhong; Zhu, Yulin; Liu, Yan; Wang, Xiaowu; Wang, Linding	The role of clinical laboratory data in the differential diagnosis of the severe forms of COVID-19 has not been definitely established. The aim of this study was to look for the warning index in severe COVID-19 patients. We investigated forty-three adult patients with COVID-19. The patients were classified into mild group (28 patients) and severe group (15 patients). Comparison of the haematological parameters between the mild and severe groups showed significant differences in IL-6, D-Dimer, GLU, TT, FIB and CRP (P <0.05). The optimal threshold and area under the ROC curve of IL-6 were 24.3 pg/mL and 0.795 respectively, while those of D-Dimer were 0.28 Âµg/L and 0.750, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of IL-6 combined with D-Dimer was 0.840. The specificity of predicting the severity of COVID-19 during IL-6 and D-Dimer tandem testing was up to 93.3%, while the sensitivity of IL-6 and D-Dimer by parallel test in the severe COVID-19 was 96.4%. IL-6 and D-Dimer were closely related to the occurrence of severe COVID-19 in the adult patients, and their combined detection had the highest specificity and sensitivity for early prediction of the severity of COVID-19 patients, which has important clinical value.

Promising methods for detection of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2	Liu, Ran; Fu, Aisi; Deng, Zixin; Li, Yan; Liu, Tiangang	Abstract A very recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and its subsequent spread within and across China have resulted in several deaths and infections. Presently, nucleic acid amplification test is essential for the confirmation of COVID infection. In this report, we summarized the six promising methods, including whole-genome sequencing, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, nanopore target sequencing, antibody-based immunoassay techniques, use of paper-based biomolecular sensors, and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas system-based technology, which can also be deployed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. We further introduced the principles of these methods, discussed the scope and practicability of application of the available products and methods, and highlighted the potential approaches to develop additional products and techniques for early diagnosis of COVID-19.	2020	NA	View	1	1	e4-e4	NA	10.1002/viw2.4	12531	#11776	Liu 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Virology, immunology	10.1002/viw2.4	Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China	('China', 2)
Analysis of heart injury laboratory parameters in 273 COVID-19 patients in one hospital in Wuhan, China	Han, Huan; Xie, Linlin; Liu, Rui; Yang, Jie; Liu, Fang; Wu, Kailang; Chen, Lang; Hou, Wei; Feng, Yong; Zhu, Chengliang	Abstact An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic spreads rapidly worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused mildly to seriously and fatally respiratory, enteric, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. In this study, we detected and analyzed the main laboratory indicators related to heart injury, CK-MB, MYO, ultra-TnI and NT-proBNP, in 273 COVID-19 patients and investigated the correlation between heart injury and severity of the disease. It was found that higher concentration in venous blood of CK-MB, MYO, ultra-TnI and NT-proBNP were associated with the severity and case-fatality rate of COVID-19.

Prominent changes in blood coagulation of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection	Han, Huan; Yang, Lan; Liu, Rui; Liu, Fang; Wu, Kai-Lang; Li, Jie; Liu, Xing-Hui; Zhu, Cheng-Liang	Background As the number of patients increases, there is a growing understanding of the form of pneumonia sustained by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused an outbreak in China. Up to now, clinical features and treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in detail. However, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and coagulation has been scarcely addressed. Our aim is to investigate the blood coagulation function of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods In our study, 94 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. We prospectively collect blood coagulation data in these patients and in 40 healthy controls during the same period. Results Antithrombin values in patients were lower than that in the control group (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The values of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and fibrinogen (FIB) in all SARS-CoV-2 cases were substantially higher than those in healthy controls. Moreover, D-dimer and FDP values in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher than those in patients with milder forms. Compared with healthy controls, prothrombin time activity (PT-act) was lower in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thrombin time in critical SARS-CoV-2 patients was also shorter than that in controls. Conclusions The coagulation function in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is significantly deranged compared with healthy people, but monitoring D-dimer and FDP values may be helpful for the early identification of severe cases.	2020	NA	Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1515/cclm-2020-0188	8928	#8776	Han 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1515/cclm-2020-0188	Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.R.

Anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients with coagulopathy	Tang, Ning; Bai, Huan; Chen, Xing; Gong, Jiale; Li, Dengju; Sun, Ziyong	BACKGROUND: A relatively high mortality of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is worrying, the application of heparin in COVID-19 has been recommended by some expert consensus due to the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation and venous thromboembolism. However, its efficacy remains to be validated. METHODS: Coagulation results, medications and outcomes of consecutive patients being classified as severe COVID-19 in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analysed. The 28-day mortality between heparin users and nonusers were compared, also in different risk of coagulopaphy which was stratified by theÂ sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score or D-dimer result. RESULTS: There were 449 patients with severe COVID-19 enrolled into the study, 99 of them received heparin (mainly with low molecular weight heparin, LMWH) for 7 days or longer. The D-dimer, prothrombin time and age were positively, and platelet count was negatively, correlated with 28-day mortality in multivariate analysis. No difference on 28-day mortality was found between heparin users and nonusers (30.3% vs 29.7%, P=0.910). But the 28-day mortality of heparin users were lower than nonusers In patients with SIC score â‰¥4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, P=0.029), or D-dimer > 6 fold of upper limit of normal (32.8% vs 52.4%, P=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulant therapy mainly with LMWH appears to be associated with better prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients meeting SIC criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer.	2020	NA	Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/jth.14817	17671	#17504	Tang 2020	NA	* Comparative study, RCT; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/jth.14817	Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China	('China', 14)
Controversial treatments: an updated understanding of the Coronavirus Disease 2019	Zhang, Cantong; Huang, Shaoying; Zheng, Fengping; Dai, Yong	Abstract An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy. In the absence of specific treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to learn from the experience and lessons in China. To reduce the case-fatality rate among COVID-19 patients, we should not ignore the complications, such as RNAaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ dysfunction. To help understand the advantages and limitations of differential treatments, we provide a timely review and discuss the complications and corresponding major treatments, especially controversial ones such as antiviral therapy (remdesivir, ribavirin, chloroquine), glucocorticoid therapy, extracorporeal support including an artificial liver system (ALS) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), based on available evidence. As a result, we suggest that antiviral therapy and organ function support are vital to reduce mortality for mild patients and critical patients, respectively. This article is protected by copyright.

Recent advances in the detection of respiratory virus infection in humans	Zhang, N.; Wang, L.; Deng, X.; Liang, R.; Su, M.; He, C.; Hu, L.; Su, Y.; Ren, J.; Yu, F.; Du, L.; Jiang, S.	Respiratory tract viral infection caused by viruses or bacteria is one of the most common diseases in human worldwide, while those caused by emerging viruses, such as the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV that caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China most recently, have posed great threats to global public health. Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics. Conventional diagnostic tests, such as the assays for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens, are widely used in many clinical laboratories. With the development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray-based assays, are emerging. This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, human adenovirus (hAdV), and human rhinovirus (hRV). Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are also described. It is anticipated that such data will assist researchers and clinicians to develop appropriate diagnostic strategies for timely and effective detection of respiratory virus infections.

Using Artificial Intelligence in Infection Prevention	Fitzpatrick, Fidelma; Doherty, Aaron; Lacey, Gerard	Artificial intelligence (AI) offers huge potential in infection prevention and control (IPC). We explore its potential IPC benefits in epidemiology, laboratory infection diagnosis, and hand hygiene. AI has the potential to detect transmission events during outbreaks or predict high-risk patients, enabling development of tailored IPC interventions. AI offers opportunities to enhance diagnostics with objective pattern recognition, standardize the diagnosis of infections with IPC implications, and facilitate the dissemination of IPC expertise. AI hand hygiene applications can deliver behavior change, though it requires further evaluation in different clinical settings. However, staff can become dependent on automatic reminders, and performance returns to baseline if feedback is removed. Advantages for IPC include speed, consistency, and capability of handling infinitely large datasets. However, many challenges remain; improving the availability of high-quality representative datasets and consideration of biases within preexisting databases are important challenges for future developments. AI in itself will not improve IPC; this requires culture and behavior change. Most studies to date assess performance retrospectively so there is a need for prospective evaluation in the real-life, often chaotic, clinical setting. Close collaboration with IPC experts to interpret outputs and ensure clinical relevance is essential.	2020	NA	Current Treatment Options in Infectious Diseases	NA	NA	10-Jan	NA	10.1007/s40506-020-00216-7	10272	#10323	Fitzpatrick 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Infection prevention and control; Other related diseases and viruses	10.1007/s40506-020-00216-7	Department of Clinical Microbiology, The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland|Department of Microbiology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland	('Ireland', 3)
Favipiravir: pharmacokinetics and concerns about clinical trials for 2019-nCoV infection	Du, Yin-Xiao; Chen, Xiao-Ping	Abstract An outbreak of 2019-nCoV infection in China has spread across the world. No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of COVID-2019. In addition to the recommended antiviral drugs such as interferon-?, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and chloroquine phosphate, some clinical trials focusing on virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors have been registered and initiated. Favipiravir, a purine nucleic acid analog and potent RdRp inhibitor approved for use in influenza, is also considered in several clinical trials. Herein, we summarized the pharmacokinetic characteristics of favipiravir and possible drug-drug interactions from the view of drug metabolism. We hope this will be helpful for the design of clinical trials for favipiravir in COVID-2019, as data regarding in vitro virus inhibition and efficacy in preclinical animal studies are still not available.	2020	NA	Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/cpt.1844	31072	#30729	Du 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/cpt.1844	Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008 Hunan, PR China|Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Changsha, 410008 Hunan, PR China|Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008 Hunan, PR China|Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Changsha, 410008 Hunan, PR China|Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008 Hunan, PR China|Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Changsha, 410008 Hunan, PR China|Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008 Hunan, PR China|Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Changsha, 410008 Hunan, PR China	('China', 8)
COVID-19: The Uninvited Guest in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Implications for Pharmacotherapy	Stringer, Kathleen A.; Puskarich, Michael A.; Kenes, Michael T.; Dickson, Robert P.	Abstract As the number of cases of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) rise in the United States (US), the number of severe cases (those requiring ICU admission) rise with it. Initially, the estimate for severe cases was approximated at 5% based on experience from China.1, 2 However, the World Health Organization?s (WHO) estimate from China for severe and critical cases is near 20% (Table).3 The primary clinical feature of COVID-19 is pneumonia, the severity of which directs the clinical course; it has been estimated that, of patients admitted to the ICU, up to half may require either invasive or non-invasive ventilatory support.4 This has created an unprecedented situation for emergency and critical care medicine.	2020	NA	Pharmacotherapy: The Journal of Human Pharmacology and Drug Therapy	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/phar.2394	45184	#42038	Stringer 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/phar.2394	Department of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, United States|University of Michigan, College of Pharmacy, 428 Church Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48109|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minnesota, United States|Department of Emergency Medicine, Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN, United States|Department of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, United States|Department of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, United States|University of Michigan, College of Pharmacy, 428 Church Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48109|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minnesota, United States|Department of Emergency Medicine, Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN, United States|Department of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, United States	('United States', 8)

Maternal and Perinatal Outcomes with COVID-19: a systematic review of 108 pregnancies	Zaigham, Mehreen; Andersson, Ola	INTRODUCTION: The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has exposed vulnerable populations to an unprecedented global health crisis. The knowledge gained from previous human coronavirus outbreaks suggests that pregnant women and their fetuses are particularly susceptible to poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to summarize the clinical manifestations and maternal and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched databases for all case reports and series from February 12 to April 4, 2020. Multiple terms and combinations were used including COVID-19, pregnancy, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, complications, clinical manifestations, neonatal morbidity, intrauterine fetal death, neonatal mortality and SARS-CoV-2. Eligibility criteria included peer-reviewed publications written in English or Chinese and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or dual fluorescence PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, cases with suspected COVID-19 that were not confirmed by a laboratory test, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes were excluded. Data on clinical manifestations, maternal and perinatal outcomes including vertical transmission were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Eighteen articles reporting data from 108 pregnancies between December 8, 2019 and April 1, 2020 were included in the current study. Most reports described women presenting in the third trimester with fever (68%) and coughing (34%). Lymphocytopenia (59%) with elevated C-reactive protein (70%) was observed and 91% were delivered by cesarean section. Three maternal intensive care unit admissions were noted but no maternal deaths. One neonatal death and one intrauterine death were also reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of mothers were discharged without any major complications, severe maternal morbidity as a result of COVID-19 and perinatal deaths were reported. Vertical transmission of the COVID-19 could not be ruled out. Careful monitoring of pregnancies with COVID-19 and measures to prevent neonatal infection are warranted.	2020	NA	Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/aogs.13867	37894	#38802	Zaigham 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/aogs.13867	Department of Clinical Sciences Malm√∂, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Lund University and Sk√•ne University Hospital, Malm√∂/Lund, Sweden|Department of Clinical Sciences Lund, Pediatrics/Neonatology, Lund University, Department of Neonatology, Sk√•ne University Hospital, Malm√∂/Lund, Sweden|Department of Clinical Sciences Malm√∂, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Lund University and Sk√•ne University Hospital, Malm√∂/Lund, Sweden|Department of Clinical Sciences Lund, Pediatrics/Neonatology, Lund University, Department of Neonatology, Sk√•ne University Hospital, Malm√∂/Lund, Sweden	('Sweden', 4)
Proposal of a low-dose, long-pitch, dual-source chest CT protocol on third-generation dual-source CT using a tin filter for spectral shaping at 100Â kVp for CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients: a feasibility study	Agostini, Andrea; Floridi, Chiara; Borgheresi, Alessandra; Badaloni, Myriam; Esposto Pirani, Paolo; Terilli, Filippo; Ottaviani, Letizia; Giovagnoni, Andrea	To subjectively and objectively evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic reliability of a low-dose, long-pitch dual-source chest CT protocol on third-generation dual-source CT (DSCT) with spectral shaping at 100SnÂ kVp for COVID-19 patients. Patients with COVID-19 and positive swab-test undergoing to a chest CT on third-generation DSCT were included. The imaging protocol included a dual-energy acquisition (HD-DECT, 90/150SnÂ kVp) and fast, low-dose, long-pitch CT, dual-source scan at 100SnÂ kVp (LDCT). Subjective (Likert Scales) and objective (signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, SNR and CNR) analyses were performed; radiation dose and acquisition times were recorded. Nonparametric tests were used. The median radiation dose was lower for LDCT than HD-DECT (Effective dose, ED: 0.28Â mSv vs. 3.28Â mSv, pâ€‰=â€‰0.016). LDCT had median acquisition time of 0.62Â s (vs 2.02Â s, pâ€‰=â€‰0.016). SNR and CNR were significantly different in several thoracic structures between HD-DECT and LDCT, with exception of lung parenchyma. Qualitative analysis demonstrated significant reduction in motion artifacts (pâ€‰=â€‰0.031) with comparable diagnostic reliability between HD-DECT and LDCT. Ultra-low-dose, dual-source, fast CT protocol provides highly diagnostic images for COVID-19 with potential for reduction in dose and motion artifacts.	2020	NA	La radiologia medica	NA	NA	9-Jan	NA	10.1007/s11547-020-01179-x	26034	#23696	Agostini 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s11547-020-01179-x	Department of Clinical, Special and Dental Sciences, University Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, AN, Italy	('Italy', 1)

Epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the early outbreak period: a scoping review	Adhikari, Sasmita Poudel; Meng, Sha; Wu, Yu-Ju; Mao, Yu-Ping; Ye, Rui-Xue; Wang, Qing-Zhi; Sun, Chang; Sylvia, Sean; Rozelle, Scott; Raat, Hein; Zhou, Huan	The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019. As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11â€‰791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and Oâ€™Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authorsâ€™ affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references. Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virusâ€™ origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.	2020	NA	Infectious Diseases of Poverty	9	1	29-29	NA	10.1186/s40249-020-00646-x	9073	#9119	Adhikari 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; * Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Infection prevention and control	10.1186/s40249-020-00646-x	Department of Communication Studies, California State University, Long Beach, CA, 90802, USA|Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC‚ÄîUniversity Medical Center Rotterdam, 3000, CA, Rotterdam, The Netherlands	('USA', 1)|('Netherlands', 1)

Frequency of arrhythmia in novel coronavirus 2019 infection	Joob, Beuy; Wiwanitkit, Viroj	Dear Editor, novel coronavirus 2019 infection is a new coronavirus disease that was firstly reported from China.1 The disease is a respiratory infection but there might be atypical presentation. Focusing on atypical presentation, arrhythmia is a possible clinical problem. Here, the authors performed a summative analysis on available data to calculate for the expected rate of arrhythmia in novel coronavirus 2019 infection. Available data on 314 cases of novel coronavirus 2019 infections2-4 are summarized and further analyzed. Of those 314 cases, lymphocytopenia is detected in 16 cases. The expected rate is equal to 4.46% (95% confidence interval = 2.67%â€7.44%). Based on this observation, arrhythmia is a possible uncommon clinical presentation of the new disease. However, the exact mechanism of arrhythmia is unknown. Additional study on the exact pathophysiology of arrhythmia in novel coronavirus 2019 infection is interesting.	2020	NA	Journal of Arrhythmia	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/joa3.12330	7875	#7553	Joob 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1002/joa3.12330	Department of Community Medicine, Dr DY Patil University, Pune, India|Department of Tropical Medicine, Hainan Medical University, Haikou, China|Department of Community Medicine, Dr DY Patil University, Pune, India|Department of Tropical Medicine, Hainan Medical University, Haikou, China	('India', 2)|('China', 2)

Imported Novel Coronavirus Infections: Observation on Active and Passive Case Detection in Thailand	Sookaromdee, Pathum; Wiwaniveitkit, Viroj	In December 2019, a viral disease â€“ the novel coronavirus â€“ emerged in China and spread widely.1 At present, the disease has already exported to many countries,2 and is becoming an important public health problem. Thailand is a Southeast Asian country that has many international flights connecting to China and there are already imported cases of the disease in Thailand. The first ex-China case of the new disease was detected in Thailand. We would like to share observations on the spread of this disease in Thailand. To date (24 January 2020), there are imported cases of novel coronavirus infections in Thailand. Of these cases, 1 patient is a Thai who returned from tourism activity in China and the others are 4 Chinese tourists. Focusing on disease detection, 4 patients were detected at health screening points at immigration posts at international airports. The Thai patient visited the physician herself after developing a fever upon returning to Thailand. Of interest, during the period of disease outbreak, active screening is done at Thai international airports and 21,374 travelers have already been screened. Active screening can detect 80% of imported cases; 20% are detected passively. Based on these data, it has been demonstrated that active screening at the airport is still a good method for detecting new emerging disease but it cannot provide 100% efficacy in case detection. The health-related self-concern of the patient is also important to help with passive case detection. Therefore, promotion of health knowledge concerning the new disease is very important for the international traveler.	2020	NA	Population Health Management	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1089/pop.2020.0014	2611	#3117	Sookaromdee 2020	NA	* Case study/series; * Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology	10.1089/pop.2020.0014	Department of Community Medicine, Dr. D.Y.

Protein structure and sequence re-analysis of 2019-nCoV genome refutes snakes as its intermediate host or the unique similarity between its spike protein insertions and HIV-1	Zhang, Chengxin; Zheng, Wei; Huang, Xiaoqiang; Bell, Eric W.; Zhou, Xiaogen; Zhang, Yang	As the infection of 2019-nCoV coronavirus is quickly developing into a global pneumonia epidemic, careful analysis of its transmission and cellular mechanisms is sorely needed. In this report, we first analyzed two recent studies which concluded that snakes are the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV and that the 2019-nCoV spike protein insertions shared a unique similarity to HIV-1. The re-implementation of the analyses, built on larger-scale datasets using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and databases, present however clear evidences rebutting these conclusions. Next, using metagenomic samples from Manis javanica we assembled a draft genome of the 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus, which shows 73% coverage and 91% sequence identity to the 2019-nCoV genome. In particular, the alignments of the spike surface glycoprotein receptor binding domain revealed 4-fold more variations in the bat coronavirus RaTG13 than those in the Manis coronavirus compared to 2019-nCoV, suggesting the pangolin as a missing link in the transmission of 2019-nCoV from bats to human.	2020	NA	Journal of Proteome Research	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00129	12000	#11127	Zhang 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00129	Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2218, United States|Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2218, United States|Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2218, United States|Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2218, United States|Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2218, United States|Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2218, United States|University of Nottingham|University of Nottingham|Institutional Sales	('United States', 6)
An SIS model for the epidemic dynamics with two phases of the human day-to-day activity	Seno, Hiromi	An SIS model is analyzed to consider the contribution of community structure to the risk of theÂ spread of a transmissible disease. We focus on the human day-to-day activity introduced by commuting to a central place for the social activity. We assume that the community is classified into two subpopulations: commuter and non-commuter, of which the commuter has two phases of the day-to-day activity: private and social. Further we take account of the combination of contact patterns in two phases, making use of mass-action and ratio-dependent types for the infection force. We investigate the dependence of the basic reproduction number on the commuter ratio and the daily expected duration at the social phase as essential factors characterizing the community structure, and show that the dependence is significantly affected by the combination of contact patterns, and that the difference in the commuter ratio could make the risk of the spread of a transmissible disease significantly different.	2020	NA	Journal of Mathematical Biology	NA	NA	Jan-32	NA	10.1007/s00285-020-01491-0	45208	#42089	Seno 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s00285-020-01491-0	Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, Research Center for Pure and Applied Mathematics, Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan	('Japan', 1)
Analyzing the epidemiological outbreak of COVID-19: A visual exploratory data analysis approach	Dey, Samrat K.; Rahman, Md Mahbubur; Siddiqi, Umme R.; Howlader, Arpita	There is an obvious concern globally regarding the fact about the emerging coronavirus 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as a worldwide public health threat. As the outbreak of COVID-19 causes by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) progresses within China and beyond, rapidly available epidemiological data are needed to guide strategies for situational awareness and intervention.

AI-Driven Tools for Coronavirus Outbreak: Need of Active Learning and Cross-Population Train/Test Models on Multitudinal/Multimodal Data	Santosh, K. C.	The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which was identified in late 2019, requires special attention because of its future epidemics and possible global threats. Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper.	2020	NA	Journal of medical systems	44	5	93-93	NA	10.1007/s10916-020-01562-1	10245	#10003	Santosh 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1007/s10916-020-01562-1	Department of Computer Science, University of South Dakota, 414 E Clark St, Vermillion, SD, 57069, USA	('USA', 1)

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in Hangzhou: An experience to share	Diao, MengYuan; Zhang, Sheng; Chen, Dechang; Hu, Wei	Current situation in Hangzhou Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province in China, was confronted with the pandemic of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that originated in Wuhan, Hubei province1 . According to the Health Commission of Zhejiang Province2 , six cases was first reported on January 19, 2020, and the cumulative cases reached 169 as of February 20, 2020. The situation in Hangzhou was once rather severe as it was once the top ranking city with respect to number of confirmed cases in Zhejiang province at the beginning of the epidemic. Since Hangzhou government took rigorous measures to contain the epidemic, positive trends have been seen. The daily number of newly confirmed cases has sharply decreased within the last week and there was only one confirmed case from February 17 to 20. Similarly, another point to be emphasized was that Hangzhou reported no deaths in its administrative region. We used a regression of log-incidence over time model3 ,which could provide a fitted trajectory for the actual daily incidence to verify the control effect. As show in Fig.1, the optimal splitting point, which was defined as the peak in number of daily new cases simulated by the model, occurred on January 25. That date was just about a week after launching the highest level of emergency public health alert and response in Hangzhou, which indicates that the prevention and control measures may be effective	NA	NA	Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology	NA	NA	5-Jan	NA	10.1017/ice.2020.62	4876	#4654	NA	NA	* Epidemiological study; * Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology; Infection prevention and control	10.1017/ice.2020.62	Department of Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, |Department of Critical Care Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, |Department of Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, |Department of Critical Care Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, 	NA
Practical recommendations for critical care and anesthesiology teams caring for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) patients	Wax, Randy S.; Christian, Michael D.	A global health emergency has been declared by the World Health Organization as the 2019-nCoV outbreak spreads across the world, with confirmed patients in Canada. Patients infected with 2019-nCoV are at risk for developing respiratory failure and requiring admission to critical care units. While providing optimal treatment for these patients, careful execution of infection control measures is necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to other patients and to healthcare workers providing care. Although the exact mechanisms of transmission are currently unclear, human-to-human transmission can occur, and the risk of airborne spread during aerosol-generating medical procedures remains a concern in specific circumstances. This paper summarizes important considerations regarding patient screening, environmental controls, personal protective equipment, resuscitation measures (including intubation), and critical care unit operations planning as we prepare for the possibility of new imported cases or local outbreaks of 2019-nCoV. Although understanding of the 2019-nCoV virus is evolving, lessons learned from prior infectious disease challenges such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome will hopefully improve our state of readiness regardless of the number of cases we eventually manage in Canada.	2020	NA	Can J Anaesth	NA	NA	10.1007/s12630-020-01591-x	32052373	10.1007/s12630-020-01591-x	723	#874	Wax 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s12630-020-01591-x	Department of Critical Care Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Queen‚Äôs University, Kingston, ON, Canada|Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Lakeridge Health, 1 Hospital Court, Oshawa, ON, L1G 2B9, Canada	('Canada', 3)
Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio is associated with prognosis in patients with Corona Virus Disease-19	Qu, Rong; Ling, Yun; Zhang, Yi-Huizhi; Wei, Li-Ya; Chen, Xiao; Li, Xumian; Liu, Xuan-Yong; Liu, Han-Mian; Guo, Zhi; Ren, Hua; Wang, Qiang	INTRODUCTION: SinceDecember 2019, novelcoronavirus infected pneumonia emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. In severe novel coronavirus pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the treatment, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR)were a concern. We sought to describe platelet feature of these cases. METHODS: Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease(COVID)-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospitalfrom January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively analysed. Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laborotary results and treatment date were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of severe patients and non-severe patients were compared. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that: age, platelet peaks and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe patients,multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients.The average hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were longer than those without platelet peaks(P<0.05).The average age of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were older than those without platelet peaks(P<0.05). The patients with significantly elevated platelets during treatment had longer average hospitalization day. And the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer average hospitalization day. CONCLUSION: Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment may have suggestion on the severity and prognosis of disease. The patient with markedly elevated platelets and longer average hospitalization day may be related to the cytokine storm. The PLR of patients means the degree of cytokine storm, which might provide a new indicator in the monitoring in patients with COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infections in China: prevention, control and challenges	Zhang, Sheng; Diao, Meng Yuan; Duan, Liwei; Lin, Zhaofen; Chen, Dechang	Since December 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that began from Wuhan, Hubei Province, has rapidly spread to 34 provincial-level divisions of China [1] and 25 countries around the world [2]. Up to February 15, 2020, 68,586 cases in China and 526 cases in other countries have been identified as having COVID-19 (eFigure 1). The estimated mortality rate is 3.1% in Wuhan, 2.8% in Hubei Province, 0.6% in other provinces of China, 2.4% in China and 0.4% in other countries, respectively. Faced with such a grim situation, the Chinese government has taken a series of unprecedented rigorous measures. First, all the 31 provincial-level divisions in China mainland have launched the highest level of responding mechanism for major public health emergency. Second, Wuhan and other 12 cities in Hubei Province have consecutively shut down all outbound transportation channels and suspended public transportation. Third, the State Council announced that both the Spring Festival holiday and winter vacation will be extended. Fourth, two emergency makeshift hospitals (Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals) with a total capacity of 2600 beds were built and more than ten cabin hospitals were renovated with more than 10,000 beds in Wuhan. Fifth, more than 30,000 members from military and public hospitals have successively headed out to Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province.ER -	2020	NA	Intensive Care Medicine	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s00134-020-05977-9	2551	#3024	Zhang 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.1007/s00134-020-05977-9	Department of Critical Care Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Hangzhou First People‚Äôs Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, Zhejiang, China|Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Changzheng Hospital, Naval Medical University (Second Military Medical University), Shanghai, 200433, China	('China', 3)

Intensive care during the coronavirus epidemic	Qiu, Haibo; Tong, Zhaohui; Ma, Penglin; Hu, Ming; Peng, Zhiyong; Wu, Wenjuan; Du, Bin; China Critical Care Clinical Trials, Group	As a response to the epidemic, the local government had appointed several designated hospitals for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite a common coping strategy for mass casualty (earthquake and blast injury) in China, SARI epidemic has proposed a new challenge for healthcare workers, especially intensivists. About 15â€“20% of suspected and confirmed patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics developed severe hypoxemia (since the second week of disease course), and required some form of ventilatory support such as high-flow nasal cannula, and non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation. In addition, other complications might occur, including, but not limited to, shock, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, and rhabdomyolysis. No antiviral agents have been proven to be effective against the coronavirus. Therefore, management of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection still remains supportive rather than definitive, indicating remarkable workload for intensive care physicians and nurses. This surge of critically ill patients in designated hospitals as well as fever clinics represents urgent demands for intensive care with regards to space, supplies, and staff (Table 1) [5,6,7,8]. Response to these demands requires cooperation between the medical rescue team, infection control specialists, local health authorities, and center for disease control and prevention [9].ER -	2020	NA	Intensive Care Medicine	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s00134-020-05966-y	1240	#1780	Qiu 2020	NA	* Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Infection prevention and control	10.1007/s00134-020-05966-y	Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei, China	('China', 6)

The number of cases worldwide is increasing exponentially and poses a major health threat, especially for those who are elderly, immuno-compromised, or have comorbidities. This also applies to AD patients on systemic immune-modulating treatment. In these days of uncertainty, reallocation of medical resources, curfew, hoarding, and shutdown of normal social life, patients, caregivers and doctors ask questions regarding the continuation of systemic immune-modulating treatment of AD patients. The ETFAD decided to address some of these questions here.	2020	NA	Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/jdv.16411	19088	#19379	Wollenberg

This is a consensus of Chinese experts on protective measures and advice on hand-cleaning- and medical-glove-related hand protection, mask- and goggles-related face protection, UV-related protection, eye protection, nasal and oral mucosa protection, outer ear and hair protection. It is necessary to strictly follow standards of wearing protective equipment and specification of sterilizing and cleaning. Insufficient and excessive protection will have adverse effects on the skin and mucous membrane barrier. At the same time, using moisturizing products is highly recommended to achieve better protection. This article is protected by copyright.

Emergency management for preventing and controlling nosocomial infection of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for the dermatology department	Tao, J.; Song, Z.; Yang, L.; Huang, C.; Feng, A.; Man, X.	Summary As of Feb 15, 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread throughout China and across the world with more than 60,000 laboratory-confirmed cases. Due to the current lack of specific treatment and the risk of transmission during the viral incubation period, infection prevention and control of 2019-nCoV are both urgent and critical to global health. In this article, we aim to highlight the necessity of implementing protective measures, and recommend how to set proper emergency management plans for preventing and controlling nosocomial infection of 2019-nCoV in dermatology departments.	2020	NA	British Journal of Dermatology	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/bjd.19011	4847	#4435	Tao 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Infection prevention and control	10.1111/bjd.19011	Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 China|Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 China|Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 China|Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 China|Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 China|Department of Dermatology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 310009 Zhejiang, China|Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 China|Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 China|Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 China|Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 China|Department of Dermatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 China|Department of Dermatology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 310009 Zhejiang, China	('China', 12)

Diagnostic performance of chest CT to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia in non-high-epidemic area in Japan	Himoto, Yuki; Sakata, Akihiko; Kirita, Mitsuhiro; Hiroi, Takashi; Kobayashi, Ken-Ichiro; Kubo, Kenji; Kim, Hyunjin; Nishimoto, Azusa; Maeda, Chikara; Kawamura, Akira; Komiya, Nobuhiro; Umeoka, Shigeaki	PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of chest CT to differentiate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia in non-high-epidemic area in Japan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 21 patients clinically suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and underwent chest CT more than 3 days after the symptom onset: six patients confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 15 patients proved uninfected. Using a Likert scale and its receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, two radiologists (R1/R2) evaluated the diagnostic performance of the five CT criteria: (1) ground glass opacity (GGO)-predominant lesions, (2) GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions, (3) bilateral GGO-predominant lesions; (4) bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions, and (5) bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions without nodules, airway abnormalities, pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. RESULTS: All patients confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia had bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions without airway abnormalities, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. The five CT criteria showed moderate to excellent diagnostic performance with area under the curves (AUCs) ranging 0.77-0.88 for R1 and 0.78-0.92 for R2. The criterion (e) showed the highest AUC. CONCLUSION: Chest CT would play a supplemental role to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other respiratory diseases presenting with similar symptoms in a clinical setting.	2020	NA	Jpn J Radiol	NA	NA	NA	32232648	10.1007/s11604-020-00958-w	27193	#28626	Himoto 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s11604-020-00958-w	Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Japanese Red Cross Wakayama Medical Center, Wakayama, 6408558, Japan|Department of Infectious Diseases, Japanese Red Cross Wakayama Medical Center, Wakayama, 6408558, Japan	('Japan', 4)

CT image visual quantitative evaluation and clinical classification of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)	Li, Kunwei; Fang, Yijie; Li, Wenjuan; Pan, Cunxue; Qin, Peixin; Zhong, Yinghua; Liu, Xueguo; Huang, Mingqian; Liao, Yuting; Li, Shaolin	To explore the relationship between the imaging manifestations and clinical classification of COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective single-center study on patients with COVID-19 from Jan. 18, 2020 to Feb. 7, 2020 in Zhuhai, China. Patients were divided into 3 types based on Chinese guideline: mild (patients with minimal symptoms and negative CT findings), common, and severe-critical (patients with positive CT findings and different extent of clinical manifestations). CT visual quantitative evaluation was based on summing up the acute lung inflammatory lesions involving each lobe, which was scored as 0 (0%), 1 (1â€“25%), 2 (26â€“50%), 3 (51â€“75%), or 4 (76â€“100%), respectively. The total severity score (TSS) was reached by summing the five lobe scores. The consistency of two observers was evaluated. The TSS was compared with the clinical classification. ROC was used to test the diagnosis ability of TSS for severe-critical type. This study included 78 patients, 38 males and 40 females. There were 24 mild (30.8%), 46 common (59.0%), and 8 severe-critical (10.2%) cases, respectively. The median TSS of severe-critical-type group was significantly higher than common type (pÂ <â€‰0.001). The ICC value of the two observers was 0.976 (95% CI 0.962â€“0.985). ROC analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of TSS for diagnosing severe-critical type was 0.918. The TSS cutoff of 7.5 had 82.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The proportion of clinical mild-type patients with COVID-19 was relatively high; CT was not suitable for independent screening tool. The CT visual quantitative analysis has high consistency and can reflect the clinical classification of COVID-19. â€¢ CT visual quantitative evaluation has high consistency (ICC value of 0.976) among the observers. The median TSS of severe-critical type group was significantly higher than common type (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). â€¢ ROC analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of TSS for diagnosing severe-critical type was 0.918 (95% CI 0.843â€“0.994).

Daily medical education for confined students during COVID-19 pandemic: a simple videoconference solution	Moszkowicz, David; Duboc, Henri; Dubertret, Caroline; Roux, Damien; Bretagnol, FrÃ©dÃ©ric	The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has recently spread globally and is now a pandemic. As a result, university hospitals have had to take unprecedented measures of containment, including asking non-essential staff to stay at home. Medical students practicing in the surgical departments find themselves idle, as non-urgent surgical activity has been canceled, until further notice. Likewise, universities are closed and medical training for students is likely to suffer if teachers do not implement urgent measures to provide continuing education. Thus, we sought to set up a daily medical education procedure for surgical students confined to their homes. We report a simple and free teaching method intended to compensate for the disappearance of daily lessons performed in the surgery department using the Google Hangouts application. This video conference method can be applied to clinical as well as anatomy lessons. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	2020	NA	Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)

Estimated effectiveness of symptom and risk screening to prevent the spread of COVID-19	Gostic, Katelyn; Gomez, Ana C. R.; Mummah, Riley O.; Kucharski, Adam J.; Lloyd-Smith, James O.	Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the global response. Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by travellers who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.	2020	NA	Elife	9	NA	e55570	32091395	10.7554/eLife.55570	1149	#1842	Gostic 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; * Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Infection prevention and control	10.7554/eLife.55570	Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago, United States|Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, United States|Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine, United Kingdom|Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago, Chicago, United States|Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States|Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States|Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine, London, United Kingdom|Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States	('United States', 6)|('United Kingdom', 2)

Imaging changes of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in advanced stage	Zhang, Wei	We recently reported in Intensive Care Medicine the imaging changes of acute stage from a case of 75-year-old male patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia combined acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multiple organ disfunction syndrome (MODS) who had a history of 10-year hypertension and 1-year diabetes. He presently received advanced life support treatment including respiratory support (invasive mechanical ventilation) and circulatory support (vasoconstrictor assistance), as well as intermittent renal replacement therapy (IRRT) in intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospitalâ€”a tertiary teaching hospital of medical university. Because his MODS still existed on the day 20 after symptom onset, we had to re-examine the chest computed tomographic (CT). The results showed that early changes of reticular pulmonary fibrosis appeared in Panels D, E, and F (marked by green arrows), compensatory emphysema occurred in Panels D and E (marked by blue arrows), and pulmonary cavity formation appeared in Panel F (marked by blue arrows), compared with acute stage of the day 5 after symptom onset, inflammatory lesions and ground glass shadow of Panels A and B (marked by red arrows), as well as septal line of Panel C (marked by yellow arrows).

Interventional radiology and COVID-19: evidence-based measures to limit transmission	Chandy, Poornima Elizabeth; Nasir, Muhammad Umer; Srinivasan, Sivasubramanian; Klass, Darren; Nicolaou, Savvas; Babu, Suresh B.	As we face an explosion of COVID-19 cases and deal with an unprecedented set of circumstances all over the world, healthcare personnel are at the forefront, dealing with this emerging scenario. Certain subspecialties like interventional radiology entails a greater risk of acquiring and transmitting infection due to the close patient contact and invasive patient care the service provides. This makes it imperative to develop and set guidelines in place to limit transmission and utilize resources in an optimal fashion. A multi-tiered approach needs to be devised and monitored at the administrative level, taking into account the various staff and patient contact points. Based on these factors, work site and health force rearrangements need to be in place while enforcing segregation and disinfection parameters. We are putting forth an all-encompassing review of infection control measures that cover the dynamics of patient care and staff protocols that such a situation demands of an interventional department.	2020	NA	Diagnostic and interventional radiology (Ankara, Turkey)	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.5152/dir.2020.20166	25975	#23341	Chandy 2020	NA	NA	10.5152/dir.2020.20166	Department of Emergency and Trauma Radiology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Canada|Department of Diagnostic Radiology, NHG, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, 90 Yishun Central, Singapore|Department of Emergency and Trauma Radiology and Interventional Radiology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Canada	('Canada', 2)|('Singapore', 1)
Preliminary Results of Initial Testing for Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Emergency Department	Tolia, Vaishal M.; Chan, Theodore C.; Castillo, Edward M.	INTRODUCTION: On March 10, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic due to widespread infection of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). We report the preliminary results of a targeted program of COVID-19 infection testing in the ED in the first 10 days of its initiation at our institution. METHODS: We conducted a review of prospectively collected data on all ED patients who had targeted testing for acute COVID-19 infection at two EDs during the initial 10 days of testing (March 10-19, 2020). During this initial period with limited resources, testing was targeted toward high-risk patients per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Data collected from patients who were tested included demographics, clinical characteristics, and test qualifying criteria. We present the data overall and by test results with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: During the 10-day study period, the combined census of the study EDs was 2157 patient encounters. A total of 283 tests were ordered in the ED. The majority of patients were 18-64 years of age, male, non-Hispanic white, had an Emergency Severity Index score of three, did not have a fever, and were discharged from the ED. A total of 29 (10.2%) tested positive. Symptoms-based criteria most associated with COVID-19 were the most common criteria identified for testing (90.6%). All other criteria were reported in 5.51-43.0% of persons being tested. Having contact with a person under investigation was significantly more common in those who tested positive compared to those who tested negative (63% vs 24.5%, respectively). The majority of patients in both results groups had at least two qualifying criteria for testing (75.2%). CONCLUSION: In this review of prospectively collected data on all ED patients who had targeted testing for acute COVID-19 infection at two EDs in the first 10 days of testing, we found that 10.2% of those tested were identified as positive.

2019-nCoV: The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool Applied to a Novel Emerging Coronavirus	Koenig, Kristi L.; Bey, Christian K.; McDonald, Eric C.	2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging infectious disease closely related to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that was first reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (31) Tool, originally conceived for the initial detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjusted for other infectious agents, can be adapted for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 31 Tool for use in the initial detection and management of patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV. After initial assessment for symptoms and epidemiological risk factors, including travel to affected areas and exposure to confirmed 2019-nCoV patients within 14 days, patients are classified in a risk-stratified system. Upon confirmation of a suspected 2019-nCoV case, affected persons must immediately be placed in airborne infection isolation and the appropriate public health agencies notified. This modified 31 Tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing persons with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV.	2020	NA	Western Journal of Emergency Medicine	21	2	184-190	WOS:000517818500001	10.5811/westjem.2020.1.46760	10653	#10136	Koenig 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.5811/westjem.2020.1.46760	Department of Emergency Medicine (UCI)	NA
Network pharmacology-based analysis of the role of traditional Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment of COVID-19	Yu, Shengwei; Wang, Junwu; Shen, Haitao	BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus named COVID-19, which originated in Wuhan, China, has spread to many countries around the world. Currently, no effective medical treatment exists to combat this disease. Traditional Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) have unique roles in the treatment of viral infections. In this article we analyzed the effectiveness and possible molecular mechanisms of CHM formulas for the prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: The active ingredients and action targets of CHM formulas were obtained from the TCMSP database. Genes related to severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) were queried on the GeneCards database. The action mechanisms of these genes were predicted using a Gene Ontology (GO)-based functional enrichment and annotation tool and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). RESULTS: CHM formulas played a positive role in preventing COVID-19 and warrant further application. CONCLUSIONS: Our research provides new evidence to support the possible value of CHM formulas for the prevention of COVID-19. However, further clinical studies with large sample sizes are required to verify their effectiveness.	2020	NA	Ann Palliat Med	NA	NA	NA	32233641	10.21037/apm.2020.03.27	31802	#31847	Yu 2020	NA	NA	10.21037/apm.2020.03.27	Department of Emergency Medicine, 	NA

Global health training in U.S. emergency medicine residency programs	Rybarczyk, Megan M.; Muck, Andrew; Kolkowitz, Ilan; Tupesis, Janis P.; Jacquet, Gabrielle A.	Abstract Objectives Formal education in Global Health (GH) and short-term experiences in Global Health (STEGH) are offered by many Emergency Medicine (EM) residency programs in the United States (US). In an increasingly connected world, training in GH and STEGH can provide essential knowledge and practical skills to trainees, particularly at the Graduate Medical Education (GME) level. The current core programmatic components and the essential competencies and curricula that support ethical and effective STEGH, however, still vary widely.Â The authors conducted a survey of 228 EM residency programs in the US in order to describe the current state of GH training and STEGH. Methods An online survey was developed in REDCap by the authors a team of GH faculty. In July 2018 programs were invited to participate via individual invitation of program directors from a directory. The programs received two reminders to participate until January 2019. Results Of the 84 programs that responded, 75% offer STEGH and 39% have longitudinal GH curricula. Within these programs, only 55% have dedicated GH faculty and only 70% have dedicated sites. Both faculty and residents encounter funding and insurance barriers; most notably, only 20% of programs that offer STEGH provide evacuation insurance for their residents.Â Most residents (95%) engage in clinical work along with teaching and other activities, but 24% of programs do not allow these activities to fulfill any residency requirements. Finally, only 80% and 85% of programs offer preparatory and debriefing activities for residents, respectively. Conclusions While the results of this survey show progress relative to prior surveys, there is still barriers to implementing GH curricula and supporting safe, ethical, and effective STEGH, particularly in the form of continued financial and logistical support for faculty and for residents, in US EM training programs.	2020	NA	AEM Education and Training	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/aet2.10451	19176	#19461	Rybarczyk 2020	NA	Ethics, social science, economics	10.1002/aet2.10451	Department of Emergency Medicine, Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital, Boston, MA, US|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Texas Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, US|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Wisconsin, School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, US|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Wisconsin, School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, US|Department of Emergency Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Boston, US|Department of Emergency Medicine, Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital, Boston, MA, US|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Texas Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, US|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Wisconsin, School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, US|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Wisconsin, School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, US|Department of Emergency Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Boston, US	NA

Headaches Associated with Personal Protective Equipment - A Cross-sectional Study Amongst Frontline Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 (HAPPE Study)	Jy Ong, Jonathan; Bharatendu, Chandra; Goh, Yihui; Zy Tang, Jonathan; Wx Sooi, Kenneth; Lin Tan, Yi; Yq Tan, Benjamin; Teoh, Hock-Luen; Ting Ong, Shi; Allen, David M.; Sharma, Vijay K.	BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease of pandemic proportions. Healthcare workers in Singapore working in high-risk areas were mandated to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 face-mask and protective eyewear while attending to patients. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the risk factors associated with the development of de novo PPE-associated headaches as well as the perceived impact of these headaches on their personal health and work performance. The impact of COVID-19 on pre-existing headache disorders was also investigated. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study amongst healthcare workers at our tertiary institution who were working in high-risk hospital areas during COVID-19. All respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 158 healthcare workers participated in the study. Majority [126/158 (77.8%)] were aged 21-35 years. Participants included nurses [102/158 (64.6%)], doctors [51/158 (32.3%)] and paramedical staff [5/158 (3.2%)]. Pre-existing primary headache diagnosis was present in about a third [46/158 (29.1%)] of respondents. Those based at the emergency department had higher average daily duration of combined PPE exposure compared to those working in isolation wards [7.0 (SD 2.2) vs 5.2 (SD 2.4) hours, p<0.0001] or medical ICU [7.0 (SD 2.2) vs 2.2 (SD 0.41) hours, p<0.0001]. Out of 158 respondents, 128 (81.0%) respondents developed de novo PPE-associated headaches. A pre-existing primary headache diagnosis (OR=4.20, 95% CI 1.48-15.40; p=0.030) and combined PPE usage for >4 hours per day (OR 3.91, 95% CI 1.35-11.31; p=0.012) were independently associated with de novo PPE-associated headaches. Since COVID-19 outbreak, 42/46 (91.3%) of respondents with pre-existing headache diagnosis either 'agreed' or 'strongly agreed' that the increased PPE usage had affected the control of their background headaches, which affected their level of work performance. CONCLUSION: Most healthcare workers develop de novo PPE-associated headaches or exacerbation of their pre-existing headache disorders.	2020	NA	Headache	NA	NA	NA	32232837	10.1111/head.13811	27187	#29807	JyOng 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/head.13811	Department of Emergency Medicine, National University Hospital, Singapore, Singapore|Department of Emergency Medicine, National University Hospital, Singapore, Singapore|Department of Emergency Medicine, National University Hospital, Singapore, Singapore|Department of Emergency Medicine, National University Hospital, Singapore, Singapore|Department	('Singapore', 8)
Rethinking Residency Conferences in the Era of COVID-19	Gottlieb, Michael; Landry, Adaira; Egan, Daniel J.; Shappell, Eric; Bailitz, John; Horowitz, Russ; Fix, Megan	Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic requires a substantial change to the traditional approach to conference didactics.

Coronavirus disease 2019: International public health considerations	Greene, Christopher J.; Burleson, Samuel L.; Crosby, James C.; Heimann, Matthew A.; Pigott, David C.	Abstract On December 31, 2019, the Chinese government announced an outbreak of a novel coronavirus, recently named COVID-19. During the following weeks the international medical community has witnessed with unprecedented coverage the public health response both domestically by the Chinese government, and on an international scale as cases have spread to dozens of countries. While much regarding the virus and the Chinese public health response is still unknown, national and public health institutions globally are preparing for a pandemic. As cases and spread of the virus grow, emergency and other front-line providers may become more anxious about the possibility of encountering a potential case. This review describes the tenets of a public health response to an infectious outbreak by using recent historical examples and also by characterizing what is known about the ongoing response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The intent of the review is to empower the practitioner to monitor and evaluate the local, national and global public health response to an emerging infectious disease.	2020	NA	Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians Open	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/emp2.12040	2196	#2635	Greene 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1002/emp2.12040	Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama|Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama	NA
Respiratory Support for Adult Patients with COVID-19	Whittle, Jessica S.; Pavlov, Ivan; Sacchetti, Alfred D.; Atwood, Charles; Rosenberg, Mark S.	Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic is creating unique strains on the healthcare system. While only a small percentage of patients require mechanical ventilation and ICU care, the enormous size of the populations affected means that these critical resources may become limited. A number of non-invasive options exist to avert mechanical ventilation and ICU admission. This is a clinical review of these options and their applicability in adult COVID-19 patients. Summary recommendations include: 1. Avoid nebulized therapies. Consider metered dose inhaler alternatives. 2. Provide supplemental oxygen following usual treatment principles for hypoxic respiratory failure. Maintain awareness of the aerosol generating potential of all devices, including nasal cannulas, simple face masks, and venturi masks. Use non-rebreather masks when possible. Be attentive to aerosol generation and the use of personal protective equipment. 3. High flow nasal oxygen is preferred for patients with higher oxygen support requirements. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation may be associated with higher risk of nosocomial transmission. If used, measures special precautions should be used reduce aerosol formation. 4. Early intubation/ mechanical ventilation may be prudent for patients deemed likely to progress to critical illness, multi-organ failure, or ARDS. This article is protected by copyright.

Initial clinical features of suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019 in two emergency departments outside of Hubei, China	Zhu, Wanbo; Xie, Kai; Lu, Hui; Xu, Lei; Zhou, Shusheng; Fang, Shiyuan	BACKGROUND: With an increasing number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases outside of Hubei, emergency departments (EDs) and fever clinics are facing challenges posed by the large number of admissions of patients suspected to have COVID-19. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to study the initial clinical features of patients, to better differentiate between infected and uninfected patients outside Hubei. METHODS: A total of 116 patients suspected of having COVID-19 who presented to two emergency departments in Anhui for the first time between 24 January 2020 and 20 February 2020 were enrolled in the study. The initial clinical data of these patients, such as epidemiological features, symptoms, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography findings were collected using a standard case report form on admission. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19; the remaining 84 patients were referred to as negative cases. The median age of the diagnosed patients was 46 years, but only 35 years for negative cases. History of exposure to Wuhan or COVID-19 patients in the previous 2 weeks was observed in 63% of the diagnosed and 44% of negative cases. Median time from illness onset to ED admission was 5 days for all patients, diagnosed patients, and negative cases, respectively. Fever was observed in 27 (84%) and 57 (68%) diagnosed and negative cases, respectively. Nineteen (59%) diagnosed and 24 (29%) negative cases had lymphopenia on admission in ED. A chest CT scan on admission revealed the presence of pneumonia in the majority of the diagnosed patients (30 out of 32, 94%) and in 56 (67%) negative cases. Bilateral involvement and ground-glass opacity (GGO) were present in 91% and 47% of the diagnosed patients. CONCLUSION: The initial clinical features of patients suspected of having COVID-19 in EDs outside Hubei were relatively mild. Meanwhile, diagnosed patients without definite exposure history tend to show more atypical initial clinical features in ED. No initial clinical feature was found to be specific to diagnosed patients, which could allow for early clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in EDs. We recommend strict medical observation and quarantine of all patients suspected of having COVID-19, either in the ED itself or in a dedicated quarantine facility, irrespective of initial clinical features, especially in under-resourced regions without access to rapid nucleic acid amplification tests.

Prediction of fatal adverse prognosis in patients with fever-related diseases based on machine learning: A retrospective study	Zhao, Chun-Hong; Wu, Hui-Tao; Che, He-Bin; Song, Ya-Nan; Zhao, Yu-Zhuo; Li, Kai-Yuan; Xiao, Hong-Ju; Zhai, Yong-Zhi; Liu, Xin; Lu, Hong-Xi; Li, Tan-Shi	Background Fever is the most common chief complaint of emergency patients. Early identification of patients at an increasing risk of death may avert adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to establish an early prediction model of fatal adverse prognosis of fever patients by extracting key indicators using big data technology. Methods A retrospective study of patientsâ€™ data was conducted using the Emergency Rescue Database of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital. Patients were divided into the fatal adverse prognosis group and the good prognosis group. The commonly used clinical indicators were compared. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was used to determine the optimal number of the included variables. In the training model, logistic regression, random forest, adaboost and bagging were selected. We also collected the emergency room data from December 2018 to December 2019 with the same inclusion and exclusion criterion. The performance of the model was evaluated by accuracy, F1-score, precision, sensitivity and the areas under receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC-AUC). Results The accuracy of logistic regression, decision tree, adaboost and bagging was 0.951, 0.928, 0.924, and 0.924, F1-scores were 0.938, 0.933, 0.930, and 0.930, the precision was 0.943, 0.938, 0.937, and 0.937, ROC-AUC were 0.808, 0.738, 0.736, and 0.885, respectively. ROC-AUC of ten-fold cross-validation in logistic and bagging models were 0.80 and 0.87, respectively. The top six coefficients and odds ratio (OR) values of the variables in the Logistic regression were cardiac troponin T (CTnT) (coefficient=0.346, ORâ€Š=â€Š1.413), temperature (T) (coefficient=0.235, ORâ€Š=â€Š1.265), respiratory rate (RR) (coefficient= â€“0.206,ORâ€Š=â€Š0.814), serum kalium (K) (coefficient=0.137, ORâ€Š=â€Š1.146), pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2) (coefficient= â€“0.101, ORâ€Š=â€Š0.904), and albumin (ALB) (coefficient= â€“0.043, ORâ€Š=â€Š0.958). The weights of the top six variables in the bagging model were: CTnT, RR, lactate dehydrogenase, serum amylase, heartrate, and systolic blood pressure. Conclusions The main clinical indicators of concern included CTnT, RR, SPO2, T, ALB and K. The bagging model and logistic regression model had better diagnostic performance comprehesively. Those may be conducive to the early identification of critical patients with fever by physicians.	2020	NA	Chinese Medical Journal	133	5	583-589	00029330-202003050-00012	10.1097/cm9.0000000000000675	10830	#10177	Zhao 2020	NA	* Comparative study, RCT; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1097/cm9.0000000000000675	Department of Emergency, The First Medical Center to Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China	('China', 1)
COVID-19 transmission through asymptomatic carriers is a challenge to containment	Yu, Xingxia; Yang, Rongrong	Abstract Since the first report on the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December, 2019,1 there have been 78 064 cases have been confirmed and 2715 deaths as of February 25, 2020. For any infectious disease, there are three kinds of way to control the epidemic of infectious disease-that is, to control the source of infection, to cut off transmission routes, and to protect the susceptible population. As a new infectious disease, it is difficult to develop a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 in a short period of time. So, it is not possible to protect susceptible population at present. Social distancing is one of the main ways to cut off transmission routes ? people cannot pass on infection if they do not come into contact with other people. Based on the understanding that COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets, there has been widespread use of face masks in Wuhan.	2020	NA	Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/irv.12743	31064	#30942	Yu 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/irv.12743	Department of Emergency, The People's Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Infectious Diseases, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Emergency, The People's Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Infectious Diseases, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China	('China', 4)

Influenza and obesity: its odd relationship and the lessons for COVID-19 pandemic	Luzi, Livio; Radaelli, Maria Grazia	Analyze the relationship between obesity and influenza. Basal hormone milieu, defective response of both innate and adaptive immune system and sedentariness are major determinants in the severity of influenza viral infection in obese patients. Being overweight not only increases the risk of infection and of complications for the single obese person, but a large prevalence of obese individuals within the population might increase the chance of appearance of more virulent viral strain, prolongs the virus shedding throughout the total population and eventually might increase overall mortality rate of an influenza pandemic. Waiting for the development of a vaccination against COVID-19, isolation of positive cases and social distancing are the primary interventions. Nonetheless, evidence from previous influenza pandemics suggests the following interventions aimed at improving immune response: (1) lose weight with a mild caloric restriction; (2) include AMPK activators and PPAR gamma activators in the drug treatment for obesity associated with diabetes; and (3) practice mild-to-moderate physical exercise. Due to prolonged viral shedding, quarantine in obese subjects should likely be longer than normal weight individuals.	2020	NA	Acta Diabetologica	NA	NA	6-Jan	NA	10.1007/s00592-020-01522-8	30975	#30526	Luzi 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s00592-020-01522-8	Department of Endocrinology, Nutrition and Metabolic Diseases, IRCCS MultiMedica, Milan, Italy|Department of Biomedical Sciences and Health, Universit√† degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy	('Italy', 2)
Review article: Gastrointestinal features in COVID-19 and the possibility of faecal transmission	Tian, Yuan; Rong, Long; Nian, Weidong; He, Yan	BACKGROUND: There is little published evidence on the gastrointestinal features of COVID-19. AIMS: To report on the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings of patients with COVID-19 and discuss the possibility of faecal transmission METHODS: We have reviewed gastrointestinal features of, and faecal test results in, COVID-19 from case reports and retrospective clinical studies relating to the digestive system published since the outbreak. RESULTS: With an incidence of 3%(1/41)-79% (159/201), gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 included anorexia 39.9%(55/138)-50.2%(101/201), diarrhoea 2%(2/99)-49.5%(146/295), vomiting 3.6%(5/138)-66.7%(4/6), nausea 1%(1/99)-29.4%(59/201), abdominal pain 2.2%(3/138)-6.0%(12/201), and gastrointestinal bleeding 4%(2/52)-13.7%(10/73). Diarrhoea was the most common gastrointestinal symptom in children and adults, with a mean duration of 4.1 Â± 2.5 days, and was observed before and after diagnosis. Vomiting was more prominent in children. 3.6%(5/138)-15.9%(32/201) of adult patients presented vomiting and 6.5%(2/31)-66.7%(4/6) of children. Adult and children patients can present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. The incidence of digestive manifestations was higher in the later than in the early stage of the epidemic, but no differences in digestive symptoms among different regions were found. Among the group of patients with a higher proportion of severe cases, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in severe patients was higher than that in non-severe patients (anorexia 66.7% vs 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3% vs 0%); while in the group of patients with a lower severe rate, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms were similar in severe and non-severe cases (nausea and vomiting 6.9% vs 4.6%; diarrhoea 5.8% vs 3.5%). ACE2 receptor and virus nucleocapsid protein was detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and infectious virus particles were isolated from faeces. Faecal PCR testing was as accurate as respiratory specimen PCR detection. About 36%(5/14)-53%(39/73) faecal PCR becomes positive, 2-5 days later than sputum PCR positive. Faecal excretion persisted after sputum excretion in 23%(17/73)-82%(54/66) patients for 1-11 days. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19, and had an increased prevalence in the later stage of the recent epidemic. SARS-CoV-2 enters gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and the faeces of COVID-19 patients were infectious.	2020	NA	Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/apt.15731	19100	#19417	Tian 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/apt.15731	Department of Endoscopy Center, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Endoscopy Center, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Endoscopy Center, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Endoscopy Center, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Endoscopy Center, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Endoscopy Center, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Endoscopy Center, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Endoscopy Center, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China	('China', 8)

Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2)	Ruiyun Li1, Sen Pei, Bin Chen, Yimeng Song, Tao Zhang, Wan Yang, Jeffrey Shaman	Estimation of the prevalence and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease. Here we use observations of reported infection within China, in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with SARS-CoV2, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%â€“90%]) prior to 23 January 2020 travel restrictions. Per person, the transmission rate of undocumented infections was 55% of documented infections ([46%â€“62%]), yet, due to their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of SARS-CoV2 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging.	2020	NA	Science	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1126/science.abb3221	9069	#8682	RuiyunLi1 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.1126/science.abb3221	Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.|Department of Land, Air and Water Resources, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA.|Department of Urban Planning and Design, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.|Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.|Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.|Department of Land, Air and Water Resources, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA.|Department of Urban Planning and Design, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.|Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.|Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Zoonotic implications of camel diseases in Iran	Mohammadpour, Roya; Champour, Mohsen; Tuteja, Fateh; Mostafavi, Ehsan	Abstract Approximately 60% of all human pathogens and 75% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic (of animal origin). Camel zoonotic diseases can be encountered in all camel-rearing countries. In this article, all studies carried out on camel zoonotic diseases in Iran are reviewed to show the importance of camels for public health in this country. More than 900 published documents were systematically searched to find relevant studies from 1,890 until late 2018. The collected articles were classified according to the aetiological agents. In this study, 19 important zoonotic diseases were reported among Iranian camels including listeriosis, leptospirosis, plague, Q fever, brucellosis, campylobacteriosis, tuberculosis, pasteurellosis, clostridiosis, salmonellosis, Escherichia coli infections, rabies, camelpox, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, echinococcosis, cryptosporidiosis, toxoplasmosis and dermatophytosis, most of which belong to bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal pathogens, respectively. Results show that camels are one of the most important sources of infections and diseases in human; therefore, continuous monitoring and inspection programs are necessary to prevent the outbreak of zoonotic diseases caused by this animal in humans.	2020	NA	Veterinary Medicine and Science	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/vms3.239	7869	#6989	Mohammadpour 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Other related diseases and viruses; Reservoir	10.1002/vms3.239	Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Research Centre for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran|Department of Clinical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran|Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Research Centre for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran|Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Research Centre for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran|Department of Clinical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran|Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Research Centre for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran	('Iran', 10)

Prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of covid-19 infection: systematic review and critical appraisal	Wynants, Laure; Van Calster, Ben; Bonten, Marc M. J.; Collins, Gary S.; Debray, Thomas P. A.; De Vos, Maarten; Haller, Maria C.; Heinze, Georg; Moons, Karel G. M.; Riley, Richard D.; Schuit, Ewoud; Smits, Luc J. M.; Snell, Kym I. E.; Steyerberg, Ewout W.; Wallisch, Christine; van Smeden, Maarten	Objective To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of prediction models for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and for detecting people in the general population at risk of being admitted to hospital for covid-19 pneumonia. Design Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal. Data sources PubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 24 March 2020. Study selection Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model. Data extraction At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool). Results 2696 titles were screened, and 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included. Three models were identified for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 infection (13 were machine learning based on computed tomography scans); and 10 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay. Only one study used patient data from outside of China. The most reported predictors of presence of covid-19 in patients with suspected disease included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. The most reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age, sex, features derived from computed tomography scans, C reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population (reported for all three models), from 0.81 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models (reported for 13 of the 18 models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in prognostic models (reported for six of the 10 models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. Most reports did not include a description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. Conclusion Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies is needed for collaborative efforts to develop more rigorous prediction models and validate existing ones. The predictors identified in included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

Clinical characteristics of 24 asymptomatic infections with COVID-19 screened among close contacts in Nanjing, China	Hu, Zhiliang; Song, Ci; Xu, Chuanjun; Jin, Guangfu; Chen, Yaling; Xu, Xin; Ma, Hongxia; Chen, Wei; Lin, Yuan; Zheng, Yishan; Wang, Jianming; Hu, Zhibin; Yi, Yongxiang; Shen, Hongbing	Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission. Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.	2020	NA	Sci China Life Sci	NA	NA	10.1007/s11427-020-1661-4	32146694	10.1007/s11427-020-1661-4	6030	#5706	Hu 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology	10.1007/s11427-020-1661-4	Department of Epidemiology, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China|Department of Radiology, the Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210003, China|Department of Clinical Research Center, the Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210003, China|Department of Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China|Department of Critical Medicine, the Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210003, China	('China', 5)
COVID-19 Related School Closings and Risk of Weight Gain Among Children	Rundle, Andrew G.; Park, Yoosun; Herbstman, Julie B.; Kinsey, Eliza W.; Wang, Y. Claire	The COVID-19 pandemic is causing substantial morbidity and mortality, straining health care systems, shutting down economies, and closing school districts. While it is a priority to mitigate its immediate impact, we want to call attention to the pandemic's longer-term effect on children's health: COVID-19, via these school closures, may exacerbate the epidemic of childhood obesity and increase disparities in obesity risk. In many areas of the U.S., the COVID-19 pandemic has closed schools and some of these school systems are not expected to re-open this school year. The experiences in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore suggest that social distancing orders, if lifted after short periods, will have to be periodically re-instated to control COVID-19 flare ups. In short, we anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will likely double out-of-school time this year for many children in the U.S. and will exacerbate the risk factors for weight gain associated with summer recess.	2020	NA	Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)

First two months of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) epidemic in China: real-time surveillance and evaluation with a second derivative model	Xinguang Chen, Bin Yu	Background Similar to outbreaks of many other infectious diseases, success in controlling the novel 2019 coronavirus infection requires a timely and accurate monitoring of the epidemic, particularly during its early period with rather limited data while the need for information increases explosively. Methods In this study, we used a second derivative model to characterize the coronavirus epidemic in China with cumulatively diagnosed cases during the first 2 months. The analysis was further enhanced by an exponential model with a close-population assumption. This model was built with the data and used to assess the detection rate during the study period, considering the differences between the true infections, detectable and detected cases. Results Results from the second derivative modeling suggest the coronavirus epidemic as nonlinear and chaotic in nature. Although it emerged gradually, the epidemic was highly responsive to massive interventions initiated on January 21, 2020, as indicated by results from both second derivative and exponential modeling analyses. The epidemic started to decelerate immediately after the massive actions. The results derived from our analysis signaled the decline of the epidemic 14â€‰days before it eventually occurred on February 4, 2020. Study findings further signaled an accelerated decline in the epidemic starting in 14â€‰days on February 18, 2020. Conclusions The coronavirus epidemic appeared to be nonlinear and chaotic, and was responsive to effective interventions. The methods used in this study can be applied in surveillance to inform and encourage the general public, public health professionals, clinicians and decision-makers to take coordinative and collaborative efforts to control the epidemic.	2020	NA	Global Health Research and Policy	2020;5(1):1-9	NA	NA	NA	10.1186/s41256-020-00137-4	5809	#5595	XinguangChen 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.1186/s41256-020-00137-4	Department of Epidemiology, University of Florida, 2004 Mowry Road, Gainesville, FL, USA	('USA', 1)

The novel coronavirus outbreak: what can be learned from China in public reporting?	Li, Hao; Chen, Xinguang; Huang, Hao	The new coronavirus outbreak gets everyoneâ€™s attention. Chinaâ€™s national actions against the outbreak have contributed great contributions to the world. China has been learning from practice for better reporting and is fast to adapt itself. In this article we discuss Chinaâ€™s practice in public reporting and its implications to global health. Confirmed cases, dynamic suspected cases, recovered cases, and deaths have been reported both in accumulative numbers and their daily updates. Some ratio indictors reporting (fatality rate, recovery rate, etc.), trend reporting, and global surveillance have been applied as well. Some improvements can still be made. It is necessary to further explore the influential factors behind the indicators for interventions. Recommendations are made to the World Health Organization and other countries for better public reporting and surveillance.	2020	NA	Global Health Research and Policy	5	1	9	NA	10.1186/s41256-020-00140-9	5779	#4808	Li 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Ethics, social science, economics	10.1186/s41256-020-00140-9	Department of Epidemiology, University of Florida, Gainesville, 32610, USA	('USA', 1)
An orally bioavailable broad-spectrum antiviral inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cell cultures and multiple coronaviruses in mice	Sheahan, Timothy P.; Sims, Amy C.; Zhou, Shuntai; Graham, Rachel L.; Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Agostini, Maria L.; Leist, Sarah R.; SchÃ¤fer, Alexandra; Dinnon, Kenneth H., 3rd; Stevens, Laura J.; Chappell, James D.; Lu, Xiaotao; Hughes, Tia M.; George, Amelia S.; Hill, Collin S.; Montgomery, Stephanie A.; Brown, Ariane J.; Bluemling, Gregory R.; Natchus, Michael G.; Saindane, Manohar; Kolykhalov, Alexander A.; Painter, George; Harcourt, Jennifer; Tamin, Azaibi; Thornburg, Natalie J.; Swanstrom, Ronald; Denison, Mark R.; Baric, Ralph S.	Coronaviruses (CoVs) traffic frequently between species resulting in novel disease outbreaks, most recently exemplified by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Herein, we show that the ribonucleoside analog Î²-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931) has broad spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and related zoonotic group 2b or 2c Bat-CoVs, as well as increased potency against a coronavirus bearing resistance mutations to the nucleoside analog inhibitor remdesivir. In mice infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable NHC-prodrug (Î²-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine-5'-isopropyl ester), improved pulmonary function, and reduced virus titer and body weight loss. Decreased MERS-CoV yields in vitro and in vivo were associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral but not host cell RNA, supporting a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis in CoV. The potency of NHC/EIDD-2801 against multiple coronaviruses and oral bioavailability highlight its potential utility as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and other future zoonotic coronaviruses.	2020	NA	Science translational medicine	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883	37871	#38274	Sheahan 2020	NA	NA	10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883	Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, TN, 37232,USA|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC|Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.|Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA.|Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC|Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.|Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.|Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, TN, 37232,USA|Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, TN, 37232,USA|Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.|Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.|Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC|Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, TN, 37232,USA|Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, TN, 37232,USA|Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, TN, 37232,USA|Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, TN, 37232,USA|Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, TN, 37232,USA|Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.|Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.|Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA.|Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC|Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, TN, 37232,USA|Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC	('USA', 22)
A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence	Menachery, Vineet D.; Yount, Boyd L., Jr.; Debbink, Kari; Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Plante, Jessica A.; Graham, Rachel L.; Scobey, Trevor; Ge, Xing-Yi; Donaldson, Eric F.; Randell, Scott H.; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Marasco, Wayne A.; Shi, Zhengli-Li; Baric, Ralph S.	The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV underscores the threat of cross-species transmission events leading to outbreaks in humans. Here we examine the disease potential of a SARS-like virus, SHC014-CoV, which is currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein. On the basis of these findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. Our work suggests a potential risk of SARS-CoV re-emergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations.	2015	NA	Nat Med	21	12	1508-1513	26552008	10.1038/nm.3985	910	#1374	Menachery 2015	NA	* Narrative review; Other related diseases and viruses; Reservoir; Virology, immunology	10.1038/nm.3985	Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Bellinzona Institute of Microbiology, Zurich, Switzerland|Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA|Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA	('USA', 5)|('Switzerland', 1)
Covid-19 and diabetes mellitus: unveiling the interaction of two pandemics	Maddaloni, Ernesto; Buzzetti, Raffaella	Abstract A novel RNA betacoronavirus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has now been declared pandemic disease by WHO. Guo W et al published the first report of biochemical features in patients with diabetes and the further risk that this disease can determine to the progression of Covid-19. Among different cytokines found significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared to those without, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) which is already increased in conditions of chronic inflammation, may play a more deleterious role in Covid-19 infection. Targeting the over expression of Il-6 effects with a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor or using Janus Kinase inhibitors may be particularly helpful for treatment of Covid-19 pneumonia in diabetes.

The transmission and diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19): A Chinese perspective	Han, Y.; Yang, H.	2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has attracted the world's attention over the last month. The Chinese government has taken emergency measures to control the outbreak and has undertaken initial steps in the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19). However, SARS-CoV-2 possesses powerful pathogenicity as well as transmissibility and still holds many mysteries that are yet to be solved, such as whether the virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients or by mothers to their infants. Our research presents selected available cases of COVID-19 in China to better understand the transmission and diagnosis regarding this infectious disease. This article is protected by copyright.

DESIGN: We analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data of 95 cases with SARS-CoV-2 caused coronavirus disease 2019. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces and GI tissues. RESULTS: Among the 95 patients, 58 cases exhibited GI symptoms of which 11 (11.6%) occurred on admission and 47 (49.5%) developed during hospitalisation. Diarrhoea (24.2%), anorexia (17.9%) and nausea (17.9%) were the main symptoms with five (5.3%), five (5.3%) and three (3.2%) cases occurred on the illness onset, respectively. A substantial proportion of patients developed diarrhoea during hospitalisation, potentially aggravated by various drugs including antibiotics. Faecal samples of 65 hospitalised patients were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, including 42 with and 23 without GI symptoms, of which 22 (52.4%) and 9 (39.1%) were positive, respectively. Six patients with GI symptoms were subjected to endoscopy, revealing oesophageal bleeding with erosions and ulcers in one severe patient. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in oesophagus, stomach, duodenum and rectum specimens for both two severe patients. In contrast, only duodenum was positive in one of the four non-severe patients. CONCLUSIONS: GI tract may be a potential transmission route and target organ of SARS-CoV-2.	2020	NA	Gut	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1136/gutjnl-2020-321013	30726	#30893	Lin 2020	NA	NA	10.1136/gutjnl-2020-321013	Department of Gastroenterology	NA

Under the epidemic situation of COVID-19, should special attention to pregnant women be given?	Jiao, Jian	The sudden outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in this spring led to a serious challenge to the global public health system. So far, the number of cases in the mainland of China has exceeded 80,000. In addition to China's neighboring countries like Japan, South Korea, Thailand and India, severe outbreaks have occurred in Italy and many other countries around the world. As dated on 12(th) Mar., WHO statistics showed that the confirmed cases reported outside China rise to more than 30,000. No epidemiological data on the prevalence and proportion of severe cases in pregnant women has been reported till now. This commentary gives some opinions on the issues that may be faced by three groups of pregnant population, i.e. late pregnancy, early and middle pregnancy and pregnant medical staff.

We aimed to collate global experience and provide provisional guidance for managing paediatric IBD (PIBD) in the era of COVID-19. Methods: An electronic reporting system of children with IBD infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been circulated among 102 PIBD centres affiliated with the Porto and Interest-group of ESPGHAN. A survey has been completed by major PIBD centres in China and South-Korea to explore management during the pandemic. A third survey collected current practice of PIBD treatment. Finally guidance points for practice have been formulated and voted upon by 37 PIBD authors and Porto group members. Results: Eight PIBD children had COVID-19 globally, all with mild infection without needing hospitalization despite treatment with immunomodulators and/or biologics. No cases have been reported in China and South Korea but biologic treatment has been delayed in 79 children, of whom 17 (22%) had exacerbation of their IBD. Among the Porto group members, face-to-face appointments were often replaced by remote consultations but almost all did not change current IBD treatment. Ten guidance points for clinicians caring for PIBD patients in epidemic areas have been endorsed with consensus rate of 92-100%. Conclusions: Preliminary data for PIBD patients during COVID-19 outbreak are reassuring. Standard IBD treatments including biologics should continue at present through the pandemic, especially in children who generally have more severe IBD course on one hand, and milder SARS-CoV-2 infection on the other.

Digestive system involvement of novel coronavirus infection: prevention and control infection from a gastroenterology perspective	Li, Lian Yong; Wu, Wei; Chen, Sheng; Gu, Jian Wen; Li, Xin Lou; Song, Hai Jing; Du, Feng; Wang, Gang; Zhong, Chang Qing; Wang, Xiao Ying; Chen, Yan; Shah, Rushikesh; Yang, He Ming; Cai, Qiang	An epidemic of an acute respiratory syndrome caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, now known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), beginning in December 2019 has attracted an intense amount of attention worldwide. As the natural history and variety of clinical presentations of this disease unfolds, the extrapulmonary symptoms of the disease have emerged, especially the symptoms related to the digestive system. While the respiratory mode of transmission is well-known and likely the principal mode of transmission of this disease, the possibility of the fecal-oral route of transmission has also emerged in various case series and clinical scenario. In this review article, we summarized the published literatures to date concerning four different aspects: (a) gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (b) microbiologic and virological investigations; (c) the role of fecal-oral transmission; and (d) prevention/control infection in the digestive endoscopy room. A timely understanding of the relationship between the disease and the digestive system and implementing effective preventive measures are of great significance for a favorable outcome of the disease and can help mitigate further transmission by appropriate measures.

We analysed 74 confirmed COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms in the Zhejiang province to determine epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics. DESIGN: COVID-19 hospital patients were admitted in the Zhejiang province from 17 January 2020 to 8 February 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management and outcome data of patients with GI symptoms were analysed using multivariate analysis for risk of severe/critical type. Bioinformatics were used to analyse features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province. RESULTS: Among enrolled 651 patients, 74 (11.4%) presented with at least one GI symptom (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea), average age of 46.14 years, 4-day incubation period and 10.8% had pre-existing liver disease. Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 17 (22.97%) and 23 (31.08%) had severe/critical types and family clustering, respectively, significantly higher than those without GI symptoms, 47 (8.14%) and 118 (20.45%). Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 29 (39.19%), 23 (31.08%), 8 (10.81%) and 16 (21.62%) had significantly higher rates of fever >38.5 degrees C, fatigue, shortness of breath and headache, respectively. Low-dose glucocorticoids and antibiotics were administered to 14.86% and 41.89% of patients, respectively. Sputum production and increased lactate dehydrogenase/glucose levels were risk factors for severe/critical type. Bioinformatics showed sequence mutation of SARS-CoV-2 with m(6)A methylation and changed binding capacity with ACE2. CONCLUSION: We report COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms with novel features outside Wuhan. Attention to patients with COVID-19 with non-classic symptoms should increase to protect health providers.	2020	NA	Gut	NA	NA	NA	32213556	10.1136/gutjnl-2020-320926	18696	#18560	Jin 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1136/gutjnl-2020-320926	Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine|Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine	NA

The clinical characteristics of pneumonia patients co-infected with 2019 novel coronavirus and influenza virus in Wuhan, China	Ding, Q.; Lu, P.; Fan, Y.; Xia, Y.; Liu, M.	The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection emerged in Wuhan, China on December 2019. Since then the novel coronavirus pneumonia disease has been spreading quickly and many countries and territories have been affected, with major outbreaks in China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. Influenza virus has been known as a common pathogen in winter and it can cause pneumonia. It was found clinically that very few patients were diagnosed with both COVID-19 and influenza virus. 5 out of the 115 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were also diagnosed with influenza virus infection, with three cases being influenza A and two cases being influenza B. In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics of those patients who got infected with COVID-19 as well as influenza virus. Common symptoms at onset of illness included fever (5 [100%] patients), Cough (5 [100%] patients), shortness of breath (5 [100%] patients), nasal tampon (3 [60%] patients), pharyngalgia (3 [60%] patients), myalgia (2 [40%] patients), fatigue (2 [40%] patients), headache (2 [40%] patients), and expectoration (2 [40%] patients). The laboratory results showed that compared to the normal values, the patients' lymphocytes were reduced (4 [80%] patients), and liver function ALT and AST (2 [40%] patients, 2 [40%] patients) and C-reactive protein (4 [80%] patients) were increased when admitted to hospital. They stayed in hospital for 14, 30, 17, 12, and 19 days (28.4Â±7.02), respectively. The main complications for the patients were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (1 [20%] patients), acute liver injury (3 [60%] patients), and diarrhea (2 [40%] patients). All patients were given antiviral therapy (including oseltamivir), oxygen inhalation, and antibiotics. Three patients were treated with glucocorticoids including two treated with oral glucocorticoids. One of the five patients had transient hemostatic medication for hemoptysis. Fortunately, all patients did not need ICU care and were discharged from hospital without death. In conclusion, those patients with both COVID-19 and influenza virus infection did not appear to show a more severe condition because based on the laboratory findings, imaging studies, and patient prognosis, they showed similar clinical characteristics as those patients with COVID-19 infection only. However, it is worth noting that the symptoms of nasal tampon and pharyngalgia may be more prone to appear for those co-infection patients. This article is protected by copyright.

A comparative-descriptive analysis of clinical characteristics in 2019-Coronavirus-infected children and adults	Han, Ya-Nan; Feng, Zhan-Wei; Sun, Li-Na; Ren, Xiao-Xia; Wang, Hua; Xue, Yong-Ming; Wang, Yi; Fang, Ying	Acute respiratory disease (ARD) caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread throughout China. Children and adults show a different clinical course. The purpose of the current study is to comparatively analyze the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children and adults and to explore the possible causes for the discrepancies present. The medical records of 25 adults and 7 children confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV ARD were reviewed retrospectively. All children were family clusters. The total adult patients were differentiated into: the local residents of Wuhan, a history of travel to Wuhan and direct contact with people from Wuhan. The numbers were 14 (56%), 10 (40%) & 1 (4%), respectively. The median incubation period of children and adults was 5 days (range 3-12 days) and 4 days (range 2-12 days), respectively. Diarrhoea and/or vomiting (57.1%) were more common in children, whereas for adults it was myalgia or fatigue (52%). On admission, the percentage of children having pneumonia (5, 71.4%) was roughly the same as adults (20, 80%). 20% of adults had leucopoenia, but leukocytosis was more frequently in children (28.6%, P=0.014). A higher number of children had elevated creatine kinase isoenzyme (57.1% vs. 4%, P=0.004). Antiviral therapy was given to all adult patients but to none of the children. In summary, knowledge of these differences between children and adults will not only be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but also for a future discussion on age-specific coronavirus infection.

Liver impairment in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective analysis of 115 cases from a single center in Wuhan city, China	Zhang, Yafei; Zheng, Liang; Liu, Lan; Zhao, Mengya; Xiao, Jun; Zhao, Qiu	BACKGROUND: TheÂ SARS-CoV-2Â pandemicÂ is an ongoing global health emergency. The aim of our study was to investigate the changes of liver function and its clinical significance in COVID-19 patients. METHOD: This retrospective, single-center study was conducted on 115 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 18 to Feb 22, 2020. Liver function and related indexes were analyzed to evaluate its relationship with disease progression in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Part of the COVID-19 patients presented with varyingÂ degreesÂ of abnormality in liver function indexes. However, the levels of ALT, AST, TBIL, GGT and LDH in COVID-19 patients were not significantly different in compared with hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia patients, and the levels of albumin is even significantly higher. Levels of ALT, AST, TBIL, LDH and INR showed statistically significant elevation in severe COVID-19 cases compared with that in mild cases. However, the clinical significance of the elevation is unremarkable. Majority of severe COVID-19 patients showed significantly decreasing in albumin level and continuously decreasing in the progress of illness. Most of the liver function indexes in COVID-19 patients were correlated with CRP and NLR, the markers of inflammation. Logistic regression analysis further identified NLR as the independent risk factor for severe COVID-19, as well as age. CONCLUSIONS: Although abnormalities of liver function indexes are common in COVID-19 patients, the impairment of liver function is not a prominent feature of COVID-19, and also may not have serious clinical consequences.	2020	NA	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/liv.14455	26563	#27345	Zhang 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/liv.14455	Department of Gastroenterology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Gastroenterology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Gastroenterology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Gastroenterology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Gastroenterology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Gastroenterology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Gastroenterology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Gastroenterology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China	('China', 8)

Imaging and Clinical Features of Patients With 2019 Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: A systematic review and meta-analysis	Cao, Yinghao; Liu, Xiaoling; Xiong, Lijuan; Cai, Kailin	BACKGROUND: Currently, the epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun to spread worldwide. We aim to explore reliable evidences for the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 by analyzing all the published studies by Chinese scholars on the clinical and imaging features in novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We searched five medical databases including two Chinese and three English databases for all published articles on COVID-19 since the outbreak. A random-effects model was designed, and the imaging and clinical data from all studies were collected for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 31 articles and 46959 patients were included, including 10 English articles, 21 Chinese articles. The results of meta-analysis showed that the most common clinical manifestations were fever (87.3%, 0.838-0.909), cough (58.1%, 0.502-0.660), dyspnea (38.3%, 0.246-0.520), muscle soreness or fatigue (35.5%, 0.253-0.456), chest distress (31.2%, -0.024-0.648). The main imaging finding were bilateral pneumonia (75.7%, 0.639-0.871), and ground glass opacification (69.9%, 0.602-0.796). Among the patients, the incidence of required intensive care unit (ICU) was (29.3%, 0.190-0.395), the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was (28.8%, 0.147-0.429), the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was (8.5%, -0.008-0.179), and and the case fatality rate of patients with COVID-19 was (6.8%, 0.044-0.093). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is a new clinical infectious disease, which mainly causes bilateral pneumonia, and lung function will deteriorate rapidly. Nearly a third of patients need to be admitted to the ICU, and patients are likely to cause respiratory failure or even death. This article is protected by copyright.

Possible aerosol transmission of COVID-19 and special precautions in dentistry	Ge, Zi-yu; Yang, Lu-ming; Xia, Jia-jia; Fu, Xiao-hui; Zhang, Yan-zhen	Since its emergence in December 2019, corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted several countries, affecting more than 90 thousand patients and making it a global public threat. The routes of transmission are direct contact, and droplet and possible aerosol transmissions. Due to the unique nature of dentistry, most dental procedures generate significant amounts of droplets and aerosols, posing potential risks of infection transmission. Understanding the significance of aerosol transmission and its implications in dentistry can facilitate the identification and correction of negligence in daily dental practice. In addition to the standard precautions, some special precautions that should be implemented during an outbreak have been raised in this review.	2020	NA	Journal of Zhejiang University-SCIENCE B	NA	NA	8-Jan	NA	10.1631/jzus.B2010010	8970	#8786	Ge 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Infection prevention and control	10.1631/jzus.B2010010	Department of General Dentistry, the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310009, China	('China', 1)

Coronavirus pandemic and Colorectal surgery: practical advice based on the Italian experience	Di Saverio, Salomone; Pata, Francesco; Gallo, Gaetano; Carrano, Francesco; Scorza, Antonella; Sileri, Pierpaolo; Smart, Neil; Spinelli, Antonino; Pellino, Gianluca	Abstract Aim The current COVID-19 pandemic is challenging healthcare systems at a global level. We provide a practical strategy to reorganize pathways of emergency and elective colorectal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method The authors, all from areas affected by the COVID-19 emergency, brainstormed remotely to define the key-points to be discussed. Tasks were assigned, concerning specific aspects of colorectal surgery during the pandemic, including the administrative management of the crisis in Italy. The recommendations (based on experience and on the limited evidence available) were collated and summarized. Results Little is known about the transmission of COVID-19, but it has shown a rapid spread. It is prudent to stop non-cancer procedures and prioritize urgent cancer treatment. Endoscopy and proctological procedures should be performed highly selectively. When dealing with colorectal emergencies, a conservative approach is advised. Specific procedures should be followed when operating on COVID-19-patients, using dedicated personal protective equipment and adhering to specific rules. Some policies are described, including minimally-invasive surgery. These policies outline the strict regulation of entry/ exit into theatres and operating building as well as advice on performing procedures safely to reduce risk spreading the virus. It is likely that a reorganization of health system is required, both at central and local levels. A description of the strategy adopted in Italy is provided. Conclusion Evidence on the management of patients needing surgery for colorectal conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic is currently lacking. Lessons learnt from healthcare professionals that have managed high volumes of surgical patients during the pandemic could be useful to mitigate some risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public and healthcare staff.	2020	NA	Colorectal Disease	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/codi.15056	21137	#20596	DiSaverio 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/codi.15056	Department of General Surgery, University of Insubria, University Hospital of Varese, ASST Sette Laghi, Regione Lombardia, Italy|Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy|Department of General Surgery, University of Insubria, University Hospital of Varese, ASST Sette Laghi, Regione Lombardia, Italy|Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Via Manzoni 113, 20089 Rozzano Milano, Italy|Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Sciences, Universit√† degli Studi della Campania ‚ÄòLuigi Vanvitelli‚Äô, Naples, Italy|Department of General Surgery, University of Insubria, University Hospital of Varese, ASST Sette Laghi, Regione Lombardia, Italy|Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy|Department of General Surgery, University of Insubria, University Hospital of Varese, ASST Sette Laghi, Regione Lombardia, Italy|Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Via Manzoni 113, 20089 Rozzano Milano, Italy|Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Sciences, Universit√† degli Studi della Campania ‚ÄòLuigi Vanvitelli‚Äô, Naples, Italy	('Italy', 10)
Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio and Lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A meta-analysis	Lagunas-Rangel, Francisco Alejandro	Since March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic, with a series of confirmed cases that currently exceeded 300,000 people worldwide and with approximately 14,500 deaths. Accumulated evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 could have a dysregulation of the immune response that allows the development of viral hyperinflammation. Thus, all patients with severe COVID-19 should be screened for hyperinflammation using laboratory parameters in order to improve mortality. Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and Lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LCR) are established inflammation markers that reflect systemic inflammatory response, and both are available in almost all laboratories. In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to investigate whether NLR and LCR values can help predict clinical severity in patients with COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in complex humanitarian crises	Poole, Danielle N.; Escudero, Daniel J.; Gostin, Lawrence O.; Leblang, David; Talbot, Elizabeth A.	Over 168 million people across 50 countries are estimated to need humanitarian assistance in 2020 [1]. Response to epidemics in complex humanitarian crisesâ€”such as the recent cholera epidemic in Yemen and the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congoâ€”is a global health challenge of increasing scale [2]. The thousands of Yemeni and Congolese who have died in these years-long epidemics demonstrate the difficulty of combatting even well-known pathogens in humanitarian settings. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) may represent a still greater threat to those in complex humanitarian crises, which lack the infrastructure, support, and health systems to mount a comprehensive response. Poor governance, public distrust, and political violence may further undermine interventions in these settings. Populations affected by humanitarian crises are expected to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, due to displacement, crowded housing, malnutrition, inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) tools, and stigmatization. Disease outbreaks further reduce access to limited healthcare, which is increasingly disrupted by attacks on health facilities and the persistent overburdening of health systems. These situations escalate both the necessity and the difficulty of delivering accurate and actionable information to potentially affected populations [3]. As the international community responds to SARS-CoV-2, public health authorities in humanitarian crises begin at a disadvantage to enact appropriate infection control to prevent transmission in healthcare settings, identify infectious cases, administer supportive care and novel treatments for the seriously ill, and trace contacts. These standard public health measures are particularly difficult to perform in humanitarian settings. For example, limited public health, laboratory, and primary care services represent a barrier to testing. Providing the limited healthcare worker cadre with appropriate training and personal protective equipment, and ensuring a continuous supply chain for such, is a challenge in all settings, exacerbated in complex humanitarian crises. Frequent displacement and limited contact information may prevent effective contact tracing. Finally, intractable structural challenges such as overcrowding limit the implementation of both quarantine of those exposed and isolation of those who are ill. Given these increased vulnerabilities, humanitarian crises should be viewed as a priority for national and international bodies that seek to combat this unfolding pandemic. Resources must be identified to protect healthcare workers, develop and deploy rapid testing, improve surveillance, and enact quarantine and isolation of contacts and cases. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on crises-affected populations, governments and agencies will implement the familiar, global evidence-based approaches for combatting respiratory viruses. Respiratory hygiene is a highly effective public health intervention, supported by evidence demonstrating that the spread of respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, can be prevented by hand hygiene, safe cough practice, and social distancing [4]. Hand hygiene is a readily implemented behavior: the distribution of soap to households in humanitarian settings has been shown to increase handwashing by over 30% [5]. Furthermore, hand hygiene is an avenue of agency for protecting oneâ€™s own health, consistent with the rights to dignity and to fully participate in decisions related to assistance in humanitarian crises. Widespread introduction of alcohol-based hand rubs is also possible in many resource-limited settings, with published protocols for local production [6]. The Sphere Handbook, a collection of rights-based guidelines for humanitarian response, is the foremost authority on minimum standards for humanitarian assistance [7]. However, despite the indisputable evidence for the efficacy of hand hygiene for reducing both bacterial and viral pathogen transmission, humanitarian WASH standards are based on evidence pertaining to the prevention of illnesses transmitted by the faecal-oral route, with the focus on hand hygiene proximate to latrines [5, 8]. And yet, latrines in crisis settings are often shared and distant from residential shelters, conferring a high risk of gender-based violence [9]. Gender-based violence around latrines is an important deterrent for accessing latrine-adjacent handwashing stations, particularly for hand hygiene to prevent respiratory pathogen transmission.[truncated]	2020	NA	International Journal for Equity in Health	19	1	41-41	NA	10.1186/s12939-020-01162-y	12001	#11272	Poole 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Epidemiology	10.1186/s12939-020-01162-y	Department of Geography, Dartmouth College, Hanover, USA|Department of Epidemiology, Dartmouth College, Hanover, USA|Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

Robot assisted surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for gynecological cancer: a statement of the Society of European Robotic Gynaecological Surgery (SERGS)	Kimmig, Rainer; Verheijen, Rene H. M.; Rudnicki, Martin	All surgery performed in an epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, irrespective of the known or suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) status of the patient, should be regarded as high risk and protection of the surgical team at the bedside should be at the highest level. Robot assisted surgery (RAS) may help to reduce hospital stay for patients that urgently need complex-oncological-surgery, thus making room for COVID-19 patients. In comparison to open or conventional laparoscopic surgery, RAS potentially reduces not only contamination with body fluids and surgical gasses of the surgical area but also the number of directly exposed medical staff. A prerequisite is that general surgical precautions under COVID-19 circumstances must be taken, with the addition of prevention of gas leakage: â€¢ Use highest protection level III for bedside assistant, but level II for console surgeon. â€¢ Reduce the number of staff at the operation room. â€¢ Ensure safe and effective gas evacuation. â€¢ Reduce the intra-abdominal pressure to 8 mmHg or below. â€¢ Minimize electrocautery power and avoid use of ultrasonic sealing devices. â€¢ Surgeons should avoid contact outside theater (both in and out of the hospital).	2020	NA	Journal of gynecologic oncology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.3802/jgo.2020.31.e59	30716	#31048	Kimmig 2020	NA	NA	10.3802/jgo.2020.31.e59	Department of Gynaecological Oncology, UMC Utrecht Cancer Center, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.

Safe Delivery for COVID-19 Infected Pregnancies	Qi, Hongbo; Luo, Xin; Zheng, Yangxi; Zhang, Hua; Li, Jiafu; Zou, Li; Feng, Ling; Chen, Dunjin; Shi, Yuan; Tong, Chao; Baker, Philip N.	Abstract Since December 2019, a new coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has rapidly become prevalent in central China1. On the basis of knowledge obtained from a previous coronavirus outbreak2, pregnant women are believed to be susceptible to this virus. Once a maternal infection of COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed, childbirth becomes complicated and challenging. Efficient obstetric treatment is required, and is key to optimizing the prognosis for both mother and child. Care should be taken in determination of the timing of delivery, assessment of the indications for caesarean section, preparation of the delivery room to prevent infection, choice of the type of anesthesia, and newborn management.	2020	NA	BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/1471-0528.16231	17766	#18062	Qi 2020	NA	* Normative guidance; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/1471-0528.16231	Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016 China|Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016 China|Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Therapy, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030 USA|Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016 China|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071 Hubei, China|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, Hubei, China|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, China|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510150 Guangdong, China|Department of Neonatology, Children‚Äôs Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014 China|Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016 China|College of Life Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 7RH UK|Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016 China|Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016 China|Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Therapy, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030 USA|Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016 China|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071 Hubei, China|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, Hubei, China|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, China|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510150 Guangdong, China|Department of Neonatology, Children‚Äôs Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014 China|Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016 China|College of Life Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 7RH UK	('China', 18)|('USA', 2)|('UK', 2)
Maternal health care management during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)	Chen, Yu; Li, Zhe; Zhang, Yuan-Yuan; Zhao, Wei-Hua; Yu, Zhi-Ying	Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel type of highly contagious pneumonia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite the strong efforts taken to control the epidemic, hundreds of thousands of people were infected worldwide by Mar. 11th, and was characterized as a pandemic by World Health Organization. Pregnant women are more susceptible to the virus due to immune and anatomic alteration, though hospital visits may increase the chance of infection, the lack of medical care during pregnancy may do more harm. Hence, a well-managed system that allows pregnant women to access maternal health care with minimum exposure risk is desired during the outbreak. Here, we present the managing processes of three pregnant women that had a fever during hospitalization at gynecology or obstetrics department, then further summarize and demonstrate our maternal health care management strategies including antenatal care planning, patient triage based on risk level, admission control, and measures counteracting emergencies and newly discovered high risk cases at in-patient department. In the meantime, we will explain the alterations we have done throughout different stages of the epidemic, and also review relative articles in both Chinese and English to compare our strategies with those of other areas. Although tens of COVID-19 cases were confirmed in our hospital, no nosocomial infection has occurred and none of the pregnant woman registered in our hospital was reported to be infected.

ISTH interim guidance on recognition and management of coagulopathy in COVID-19	Thachil, Jecko; Tang, Ning; Gando, Satoshi; Falanga, Anna; Cattaneo, Marco; Levi, Marcel; Clark, Cary; Iba, Toshiaki	Abstract The novel corona virus infection (now classified as COVID-19), first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has contributed to significant mortality in several countries with the number of infected cases increasing exponentially worldwide.1 The majority of the most severely ill patients initially present with single organ failure (i.e. respiratory insufficiency) but some of them progress to more systemic disease and multiple organ dysfunction. One of the most significant poor prognostic features in those patients is the development of coagulopathy.2 In patients who develop sepsis from various infectious agents, development of coagulopathy is one of the key and persistent features which is associated with poor outcomes.3 In this context, the role of International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) would be crucial in guiding health care professionals how to manage the coagulopathy of COVID-19. A simple and easily follow-able algorithm for the management of COVID-19 coagulopathy would currently be useful in both the well-resourced and less-resourced settings as a guide in managing this complication. This pragmatic statement should clearly be considered as an interim guidance since the clinical experience of managing this pandemic is increasing. The authors are certain that this statement will be modified with developing knowledge and therapeutics in managing COVID-19. The aim of this guidance document is to provide a risk stratification at admission for a COVID-19 patient and management of coagulopathy which may develop in some of these patients, based on easily available laboratory parameters.	2020	NA	Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/jth.14810	16019	#14978	Thachil 2020	NA	* Normative guidance; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/jth.14810	Department of Haematology, Manchester University Hospitals, Oxford road, Manchester, United Kingdom|Department of Acute and Critical Care Medicine, Sapporo Higashi Tokushukai Hospital, Sapporo, Japan|University of Milan Bicocca, Dept of Medicine and Surgery, Hospital Papa Giovanni, XXIII, Bergamo, Italy|Department of Medicine and Cardio‚Äêmetabolic Programme‚ÄêNIHR UCLH/UCL BRC, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom|Department of Emergency and Disaster Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Haematology, Manchester University Hospitals, Oxford road, Manchester, United Kingdom|Department of Acute and Critical Care Medicine, Sapporo Higashi Tokushukai Hospital, Sapporo, Japan|University of Milan Bicocca, Dept of Medicine and Surgery, Hospital Papa Giovanni, XXIII, Bergamo, Italy|Department of Medicine and Cardio‚Äêmetabolic Programme‚ÄêNIHR UCLH/UCL BRC, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom|Department of Emergency and Disaster Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan	('United Kingdom', 4)|('Japan', 4)|('uk', 2)|('Italy', 2)
The versatile heparin in COVID-19	Thachil, Jecko	Coagulopathy in corona virus infection has been shown to be associated with high mortality with high D-dimers being a particularly important marker for the coagulopathy.(1) In the latest paper from the same group, the use of anticoagulant therapy with heparin was shown to decrease mortality as well. (2) This is especially so in patients i) who have met the sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria â‰¥4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, P=0.029) compared to those with SIC score <4 (29.0% vs 22.6%, P=0.419).or ii) with markedly elevated D-dimer (greater than six-fold at the upper limit of normal).	2020	NA	Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/jth.14821	26567	#27103	Thachil 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/jth.14821	Department of Haematology, Manchester University Hospitals, Oxford road, Manchester, United Kingdom|Department of Haematology, Manchester University Hospitals, Oxford road, Manchester, United Kingdom	('United Kingdom', 2)

E.; Tan, G. B.; Mucheli, S. S.; Kuperan, P.; Ong, K. H.; Peng, X.; Xu, X.; Li, Y.; Cheng, L.; Zhou, X.; Ren, B.	A novel Î²-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused severe and even fetal pneumonia explored in a seafood market of Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, and rapidly spread to other provinces of China and other countries. The 2019-nCoV was different from SARS-CoV, but shared the same host receptor the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The natural host of 2019-nCoV may be the bat Rhinolophus affinis as 2019-nCoV showed 96.2% of whole-genome identity to BatCoV RaTG13. The person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV included direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes. 2019-nCoV can also be transmitted through the saliva, and the fetal-oral routes may also be a potential person-to-person transmission route. The participants in dental practice expose to tremendous risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to the face-to-face communication and the exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids, and the handling of sharp instruments. Dental professionals play great roles in preventing the transmission of 2019-nCoV. Here we recommend the infection control measures during dental practice to block the person-to-person transmission routes in dental clinics and hospitals.	2020	NA	American journal of hematology International journal of oral science	12	1	9	32127517	10.1002/ajh.25774 10.1038/s41368-020-0075-9	13792	#12403	Fan 2020	NA	* Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Infection prevention and control	10.1002/ajh.25774	Department of Haematology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore|Department of Haematology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Haematology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Infectious Diseases, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Haematology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore|Department of Haematology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore|Department of Haematology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore|Department of Haematology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Haematology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Infectious Diseases, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Haematology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore|Department of Haematology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore	('Singapore', 22)

Covid-19: Doctors are told not to perform CPR on patients in cardiac arrest	Mahase, Elisabeth; Kmietowicz, Zosia	Healthcare staff in the West Midlands have been told not to start chest compressions or ventilation in patients who are in cardiac arrest if they have suspected or diagnosed covid-19 unless they are in the emergency department and staff are wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE). The guidance from the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust says that patients in cardiac arrest outside the emergency department can be given defibrillator treatment if they have a â€œshockableâ€ rhythm. But if this fails to restart the heart â€œfurther resuscitation is futile,â€ it says. If a patient with suspected covid-19 is in cardiac arrest they should be given cardiac compressions and be ventilated only if they are in the emergency department and the person attending them is wearing aerosol generating procedures (AGP) PPE. That means wearing an FFP3 mask, full gown with long sleeves, gloves, and eye protection. The advice rests on the premise that performing cardiac compressions risks virus particles being released into the air that could infect staff.

Covid-19: healthcare staff in hotspot areas are prioritised as testing expands	Iacobucci, Gareth	Medical leaders have welcomed the governmentâ€™s â€œbelatedâ€ decision to expand covid-19 testing capacity but said it has taken too long to commence and is still far too limited. On 27 March the government announced it was opening three new laboratories in England to focus on processing covid-19 testing samples from healthcare staff. Staff in the worst affected parts of the country, such as London, are being prioritised, especially in areas of highest impact, such as intensive care, with all health and care staff following as capacity increases.

Covid-19: testing times	Beeching, Nick J.; Fletcher, Tom E.; Beadsworth, Mike B. J.	Rapid near patient testing for both current and past infections is urgently required â€œTest, test, testâ€ is the key to controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its clinical manifestation, covid-19, according to the World Health Organisation.1 However, three months after notification of the novel coronavirus infection in China, there is inadequate access to appropriate diagnostic tests globally and confusion among healthcare professionals and the public about prioritisation of testing and interpretation of results. The virus is spread by the respiratory route, primarily by droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces and fomites, and by aerosol formation during invasive respiratory procedures. Virus is also found in urine, faeces, and saliva.2345 Asymptomatic shedding seems to be common, especially in children, and can spread infection.67 The incubation period from infection to first symptom is typically 5 to 7 days, with a range of 4-14 days. Diagnosis of current infection relies on tests to detect virus in various body fluids. Antibody tests on blood are used to confirm past infection and presumed immunity to repeat infection, although duration and effectiveness of such protection are not yet known.

Covid-19: Testing times for the governmentâ€”but not for NHS staff	Cowper, Andy	The UK government has not always stuck to its own advice on covid-19, says Andy Cowper . He argues that it must be clearer about its strategy and objectives Covid-19 is no respecter of individual people, as shown by the rapid domino effect of infections in Whitehallâ€”ranging from Chris Whitty, chief medical officer (now recovered and back at work), to the health secretary, Matt Hancock (who was visibly unwell at the opening of the NHS Nightingale Hospital at ExCeL London1), to the prime ministerâ€™s special adviser, Dominic Cummings,2 and the prime minister himself, Boris Johnson, who was admitted to intensive care on 6 April. Of course, one wishes them all a speedy recovery. It does seem, however, that central government has been a bit sketchy in following its own official advice on social distancing, to put it mildly: the prime minister actually boasted that, on an early March hospital visit, he had still shaken hands with people.3 You also have to wonder about the cleaning standards at 10 Downing Street.

Predicting COVID-19 incidence using Google Trends and data mining techniques: A pilot study in Iran	Ayyoubzadeh, Seyed Mohammad; Ayyoubzadeh, Seyed Mehdi; Zahedi, Hoda; Ahmadi, Mahnaz; R Niakan Kalhori, Sharareh	BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a recent global outbreak affecting many countries around the world. Iran is one of the ten most affected countries. Search engines provide useful data from populations and this data might be useful to analyze epidemics. Utilizing data mining methods on electronic resources' data might give better insight to manage the health crisis of coronavirus outbreak for each country and the world. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed to predict the incidence of COVID-19 in Iran. METHODS: The data is obtained from the Google Trend website. Linear regression and long short-term memory (LSTM) models have been used to estimate the number of positive COVID-19 cases. All models are evaluated using 10-fold-cross validation, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used as the performance metric. RESULTS: The Linear Regression model predicts the incidence with an RMSE of 7.562 Â± 6.492. The most effective factors besides previous day incidence include the searches' frequency of handwashing, hand sanitizer, and antiseptic topics. The RMSE of the LSTM model was equal to 27.187. CONCLUSIONS: The data mining algorithms can be employed to predict outbreak spreading trends. This prediction might support policymakers and healthcare managers to plan and allocate healthcare resources accordingly.	2020	NA	JMIR public health and surveillance	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.2196/18828	26591	#27266	Ayyoubzadeh 2020	NA	NA	10.2196/18828	Department of Health Information Management, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran|Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada|Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran|Department of Health Information Management	('Iran', 2)|('Canada', 1)
Distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic and correlation with population emigration from wuhan, China	Chen, Ze-Liang; Zhang, Qi; Lu, Yi; Guo, Zhong-Min; Zhang, Xi; Zhang, Wen-Jun; Guo, Cheng; Liao, Cong-Hui; Li, Qian-Lin; Han, Xiao-Hu; Lu, Jia-Hai	BACKGROUND: The ongoing new coronavirus pneumonia (Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID-19) outbreak is spreading in China, but it has not yet reached its peak. Five million people emigrated from Wuhan before lockdown, potentially representing a source of virus infection. Determining case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in the early stage of the epidemic is of great importance for early warning and for the prevention of future outbreaks. METHODS: The official case report on the COVID-19 epidemic was collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information on COVID-19 cases was extracted and analyzed using ArcGIS and WinBUGS software. Data on population migration from Wuhan city and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi, and their correlation with the number of cases was analyzed. RESULTS: The COVID-19 confirmed and death cases in Hubei province accounted for 59.91% (5806/9692) and 95.77% (204/213) of the total cases in China respectively. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan, which are adjacent to Hubei. The time risk of Hubei province on the following day was 1.960 times that on the previous day. The number of cases in some cities was relatively low, but the time risk appeared to be continuously rising. The correlation coefficient between the provincial number of cases and emigration from Wuhan was up to 0.943. The lockdown of 17 cities in Hubei province and the implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented an exponential growth in the number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The population that emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source in other cities and provinces. Some cities with a low number of cases showed a rapid increase in case load. Owing to the upcoming Spring Festival return wave, understanding the risk trends in different regions is crucial to ensure preparedness at both the individual and organization levels and to prevent new outbreaks.	2020	NA	Chin Med J (Engl)	NA	NA	10.1097/CM9.0000000000000782	32118644	10.1097/CM9.0000000000000782	3124	#3436	Chen 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.1097/CM9.0000000000000782	Department of Health Law, Policy and Management, School of Public Health, Boston University, Boston, MA, 02215, USA|Department of Biological Science and Technology, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China	('USA', 1)|('China', 1)
Influence of trust on two different risk perceptions as an affective and cognitive dimension during Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea: serial cross-sectional surveys	Jang, Won Mo; Kim, Un-Na; Jang, Deok Hyun; Jung, Hyemin; Cho, Sanghyun; Eun, Sang Jun; Lee, Jin Yong	OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the affective and cognitive risk perceptions in the general population of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) during the 2015 MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea and the influencing factors. DESIGN: Serial cross-sectional design with four consecutive surveys. SETTING: Nationwide general population in South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: Overall 4010 respondents (aged 19 years and over) from the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic were included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were (1) affective risk perception, (2) cognitive risk perception, and (3) trust in the government. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area and political orientation) associated with risk perceptions. RESULTS: Both affective and cognitive risk perceptions decreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed. Proportions of affective risk perception were higher in all surveys and slowly decreased compared with cognitive risk perception over time. Females (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.72-2.00; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.86) and lower self-reported household economic status respondents were more likely to perceive the affective risk. The older the adults, the higher the affective risk perception, but the lower the cognitive risk perception compared with younger adults. The respondents who had low trust in the government had higher affective (aOR 2.19-3.11; 95â€‰CI 1.44 to 4.67) and cognitive (aOR 3.55-5.41; 95â€‰CI 1.44 to 9.01) risk perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that even if cognitive risk perception is dissolved, affective risk perception can continue during MERS-CoV epidemic. Risk perception associating factors (ie, gender, age and self-reported household economic status) appear to be noticeably different between affective and cognitive dimensions. It also indicates that trust in the government influences affective risk perception and cognitive risk perception. There is a need for further efforts to understand the mechanism regarding the general public's risk perception for eï¬€ective risk communication.	2020	NA	BMJ Open	10	3	e033026-e033026	32139484	10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033026	6113	#5559	Jang 2020	NA	Ethics, social science, economics; Other related diseases and viruses	10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033026	Department of Health Policy and Management|Department of Preventive Medicine|Department of Public Health and Community Medicine|Institutional trust and misinformation in the response to the 2018‚Äì19 Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, DR Congo: a population-based survey	('DR Congo', 1)
Medical Masks vs N95 Respirators for Preventing COVID-19 in Health Care Workers A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials	Bartoszko, Jessica J.; Farooqi, Mohammed Abdul Malik; Alhazzani, Waleed; Loeb, Mark	Abstract Background Respiratory protective devices are critical in protecting against infection in health care workers at high risk of novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19); however, recommendations are conflicting and epidemiological data on their relative effectiveness against COVID-19 are limited. Purpose To compare medical masks to N95 respirators in preventing laboratory confirmed viral infection and respiratory illness including coronavirus specifically in health care workers. Data Sources MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL from January 1stÂ 2014 to March 9th 2020. Update of published search conducted from January 1stÂ 1990 to December 9thÂ 2014. Study Selection Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the protective effect of medical masks to N95 respirators in health care workers. Data Extraction Reviewer pair independently screened, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence. Data Synthesis Four RCTs were meta-analysed adjusting for clustering. Compared to N95 respirators; the use of medical masks did not increase laboratory confirmed viral (including coronaviruses) respiratory infection (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.90-1.25;Â I2=0%; low certainty in the evidence) or clinical respiratory illness (OR 1.49; 95%CI 0.98-2.28;Â I2=78%; very low certainty in the evidence). Only one trial evaluated coronaviruses separately and found no difference between the two groups (p=0.49). Limitations Indirectness and imprecision of available evidence. Conclusions Low certainty evidence suggests that medical masks and N95 respirators offer similar protection against viral respiratory infection including coronavirus in health care workers during non-aerosol generating care.

The Novel Chinese Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infections: challenges for fighting the storm	Bassetti, M.; Vena, A.; Roberto Giacobbe, D.	Since end of December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown origin was reported from Wuhan, Hubei province, China. They shared a connection with the Huanan South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, and now it has been confirmed that the disease is caused by a novel coronavirus (provisionally named 2019-nCoV). As of today (30 January 2020), 7734 cases have been confirmed in China, and 90 cases have also been cumulatively reported from Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Japan, Singapore, Republic of Korea, United Arab Emirate, United States, The Philippines, India, Australia, Canada, Finland, France, and Germany (Finland, France and Germany are the only European countries in which cases [n= 1, n = 5, and n = 4, respectively] have been reported up to date). According to the released news, the case rate fatality is 2.2% (170/7824).	2020	NA	European journal of clinical investigation	NA	NA	e13209	32003000	10.1111/eci.13209	250	#113	Bassetti 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Awaiting classification; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/eci.13209	Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy|Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy|Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy|Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy|Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy|Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy	('Italy', 6)

Population-Level Interest and Telehealth Capacity of US Hospitals in Response to COVID-19: Cross-Sectional Analysis of Google Search and National Hospital Survey Data	Hong, Young-Rock; Lawrence, John; Williams, Dunc, Jr.; Mainous Iii, Arch	BACKGROUND: As the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is widely spreading across the United States, there is a concern about the overloading of the nation's health care capacity. The expansion of telehealth services is expected to deliver timely care for the initial screening of symptomatic patients while minimizing exposure in health care facilities, to protect health care providers and other patients. However, it is currently unknown whether US hospitals have the telehealth capacity to meet the increasing demand and needs of patients during this pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the population-level internet search volume for telehealth (as a proxy of population interest and demand) with the number of new COVID-19 cases and the proportion of hospitals that adopted a telehealth system in all US states. METHODS: We used internet search volume data from Google Trends to measure population-level interest in telehealth and telemedicine between January 21, 2020 (when the first COVID-19 case was reported), and March 18, 2020. Data on COVID-19 cases in the United States were obtained from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resources Center. We also used data from the 2018 American Hospital Association Annual Survey to estimate the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (including telemedicine and electronic visits) and those with the capability of telemedicine intensive care unit (tele-ICU). Pearson correlation was used to examine the relations of population search volume for telehealth and telemedicine (composite score) with the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases in the United States during the study period and the proportion of hospitals with telehealth and tele-ICU capabilities. RESULTS: We found that US population-level interest in telehealth increased as the number of COVID-19 cases increased, with a strong correlation (r=0.948, P<.001). We observed a higher population-level interest in telehealth in the Northeast and West census region, whereas the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth was higher in the Midwest region. There was no significant association between population interest and the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (r=0.055, P=.70) nor hospitals having tele-ICU capability (r=-0.073, P=.61). CONCLUSIONS: As the number of COVID-19 cases increases, so does the US population's interest in telehealth. However, the level of population interest did not correlate with the proportion of hospitals providing telehealth services in the United States, suggesting that increased population demand may not be met with the current telehealth capacity. Telecommunication infrastructures in US hospitals may lack the capability to address the ongoing health care needs of patients with other health conditions. More practical investment is needed to deploy the telehealth system rapidly against the impending patient surge.	2020	NA	JMIR public health and surveillance	6	2	e18961-e18961	NA	10.2196/18961	37811	#38765	Hong 2020	NA	NA	10.2196/18961	Department of Health Services Research, Management and Policy, College of Public Health and Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States|Department of Health Care Leadership and Management, College of Health Professions, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, United States|Department of Community Health and Family Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States|Department of Health Services Research, Management and Policy|College of Public Health and Health Professions|University of Florida	('United States', 3)
The Politics of Disease Epidemics: a Comparative Analysis of the SARS, Zika, and Ebola Outbreaks	Kapiriri, Lydia; Ross, Alison	Over the past few decades, disease outbreaks have become increasingly frequent and widespread. The epicenters of these outbreaks have differed, and could be linked to different economic contexts. Arguably, the responses to these outbreaks have been â€œpoliticalâ€ and inherently burdensome to marginalized populations. Key lessons can be learned from exploring the narratives about the different epidemics in varying income settings. Based on a review of the published medical, social, and political literature, which was accessed using four electronic databasesâ€”PubMed, Sociological Abstracts, Scholars Portal, and Web of Science, the overall objective of this paper discuss scholarsâ€™ narratives on the â€œpoliticsâ€ of Ebola in a low-income setting, Zika virus in a middle-income setting, and SARS in a high-income setting. Various themes of the politics of epidemics were prominent in the literature. The narratives demonstrated the influence of power in whose narratives and what narratives are presented in the literature. While marginalized populations were reported to have borne the brunt of all disease outbreaks in the different contexts, the prevalence of their narratives within the reviewed literature was limited. Regardless of income setting, there is a need to give voice to the most marginalized communities during an epidemic. The experiences and narratives of those most vulnerable to an epidemicâ€”specifically poor communitiesâ€”need to be represented in the literature. This could contribute to mitigating some of the negative impact of the politics in epidemics.	2020	NA	Global Social Welfare	7	1	33-45	NA	10.1007/s40609-018-0123-y	868	#1136	Kapiriri 2020	NA	* Systematic review; Ethics, social science, economics; Other related diseases and viruses	10.1007/s40609-018-0123-y	Department of Health, Aging and Society, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON, L8S 4L8, Canada	('Canada', 1)
Effectiveness of airport screening at detecting travellers infected with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)	Quilty, Billy J; Clifford, Sam; group2, CMMID nCoV working; Flasche, Stefan; Eggo, Rosalind M	We simulated 100 2019-nCoV infected travellers planning to board a flight who would pose a risk for seeding transmission in a new region. The duration of travel was considered as the flight time plus a small amount of additional travel time (ca 1 hour) for airport procedures. We assumed that infected individuals will develop symptoms, including fever, at the end of their incubation period (mean 5.2 days (Table)) [8] and progress to more severe symptoms after a few days, resulting in hospitalisation and isolation. We also took into account that individuals may have asymptomatic (subclinical) infection that would not be detected by thermal scanning or cause them to seek medical care, although these individuals may be infectious, and that infected travellers may exhibit severe symptoms during their travel and be hospitalised upon arrival without undergoing entry screening. We then estimated the proportion of infected travellers who would be detected by exit and entry screening, develop severe symptoms during travel, or go undetected, under varying assumptions of: (i) the duration of travel; (ii) the sensitivity of exit and entry screening; (iii) the proportion of asymptomatic infections; (iv) the incubation period and (v) the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation (Table).	2020	NA	Eurosurveillance	25	5	2000080	NA	doi:https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000080	581	#682	Quilty 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology; Infection prevention and control	doi:10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000080	Department of Health.

While initial research focused on their ability to cause enzootic infections, infections which have emerged in the past two decades demonstrate their ability to cross the species barrier and infect humans [1,2]. The ensuing epidemics have included Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the more recent Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and have resulted in severe disease burden, mortality and economic disruption [3]. A novel flu-like coronavirus, emerging towards the end of 2019 and subsequently named SARS-CoV-2, has been associated with an epidemic initially focused in Wuhan, China.	2020	NA	Vox Sanguinis	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/vox.12928	27146	#26731	Franchini 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/vox.12928	Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Carlo Poma Hospital, Mantua, Italy|Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health, University of Milan, Milan, Italy|Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health, University of Milan, Milan, Italy|Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Carlo Poma Hospital, Mantua, Italy|Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health, University of Milan, Milan, Italy|Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health, University of Milan, Milan, Italy	('Italy', 6)

Uncertainties about the transmission routes of 2019 novel coronavirus	Han, Qingmei; Lin, Qingqing; Ni, Zuowei; You, Liangshun	The 2019 novel coronavirus (now named as SARSâ€CoVâ€2) caused an outbreak of SARSâ€like illness in the late of December 2019. At present, the origin, susceptible population, and infection sources already have been clear.1, 2 However, the transmission routes, a key step to the epidemic control, have not yet been fully ascertained. Here, we focus on the potential transmission routes that have been investigated in the SARSâ€CoVâ€2 epidemic recently. SARSâ€CoVâ€2, similar to SARS and MERS, is predominantly spread via respiratory tract with high infectivity. It is commonly recognized that droplet transmission is the main route. Spread by aerosol is suspected to be another important route of transmission but unestablished now. Epidemiological experts, as well as the WHO, consider more evidence is needed to confirm.3 Besides, there are other routes except respiratory transmission. The previous study indicated that different human coronaviruses, such as SARSâ€CoV and MERSâ€CoV, can maintain infectious for a different time on inanimate surfaces.4 Meanwhile, it was reported that SARSâ€CoVâ€2 was also founded on the surface of the door handles, cell phones, and other items in the residential sites of confirmed cases.5 Therefore, individuals will be probably infected if they touch the nose, mouth, or eyes after contacting the contaminated items.	2020	NA	Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/irv.12735	3806	#4142	Han 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1111/irv.12735	Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China|Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China|Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China|Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China|Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China|Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China	('China', 6)

The neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV2 may be at least partially responsible for the respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients	Li, Yan-Chao; Bai, Wan-Zhu; Hashikawa, Tsutomu	Abstract Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world. This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The most characteristic symptom of COVID-19 patients is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously. Additionally, some COVID-19 patients also showed neurologic signs such as headache, nausea and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows that coronavriruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases. The infection of SARS-CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechano- and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways. In light of the high similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, it is quite likely that the potential invasion of SARS-CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients. Awareness of this will have important guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure. (229 words) This article is protected by copyright.

Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions as a clinical presentation of mild-to-moderate forms of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a multicenter European study	Lechien, Jerome R.; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M.; De Siati, Daniele R.; Horoi, Mihaela; Le Bon, Serge D.; Rodriguez, Alexandra; Dequanter, Didier; Blecic, Serge; El Afia, Fahd; Distinguin, Lea; Chekkoury-Idrissi, Younes; Hans, StÃ©phane; Delgado, Irene Lopez; Calvo-Henriquez, Christian; Lavigne, Philippe; Falanga, Chiara; Barillari, Maria Rosaria; Cammaroto, Giovanni; Khalife, Mohamad; Leich, Pierre; Souchay, Christel; Rossi, Camelia; Journe, Fabrice; Hsieh, Julien; Edjlali, Myriam; Carlier, Robert; Ris, Laurence; Lovato, Andrea; De Filippis, Cosimo; Coppee, Frederique; Fakhry, Nicolas; Ayad, Tareck; Saussez, Sven	To investigate the occurrence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from 12 European hospitals. The following epidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms. Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study (263 females). The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms. 85.6% and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively. There was a significant association between both disorders (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8% of cases. The sQO-NS scores were significantly lower in patients with anosmia compared with normosmic or hyposmic individuals (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). Among the 18.2% of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, 79.7% were hyposmic or anosmic. The early olfactory recovery rate was 44.0%. Females were significantly more affected by olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions than males (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prevalent symptoms in European COVID-19 patients, who may not have nasal symptoms. The sudden anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized by the international scientific community as important symptoms of the COVID-19 infection.	2020	NA	European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology	NA	NA	11-Jan	NA	10.1007/s00405-020-05965-1	34416	#34916	Lechien 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s00405-020-05965-1	Department of Human Anatomy and Experimental Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, UMONS Research Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, University of Mons (UMons), Mons, Belgium|Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Foch Hospital, School of Medicine, UFR Simone Veil, Universit√© Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (Paris Saclay University), Paris, France|Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, CHU de Bruxelles, CHU Saint-Pierre, School of Medicine, Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium|Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Hospital Universitario Donostia, San Sebastian, Spain|Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, CHU Saint-Luc, Universit√© Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium|Department of Neurology, EpiCURA Hospital, Ath, Belgium|Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Hospital Quironsalud Valencia, Valencia, Spain|Department of Otolaryngology-Hospital Complex of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain|Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Morgagni Pierantoni Hospital, Forli, Italy|Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, EpiCURA Hospital, Baudour, Belgium|Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, CHU Ambroise Par√©, Mons, Belgium|Department of Neuroradiology, Universit√© Paris-Descartes-Sorbonne-Paris-Cit√©, IMABRAIN-INSERM-UMR1266, DHU-Neurovasc, Centre Hospitalier Sainte-Anne, Paris, France|Department of Radiology, APHP, H√¥pitaux R.

Angiotensin receptor blockers as tentative SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics	Gurwitz, David	At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the SARS and MERS coronavirus epidemics combined. Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.	2020	NA	Drug Dev Res	NA	NA	10.1002/ddr.21656	32129518	10.1002/ddr.21656	4580	#4134	Gurwitz 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1002/ddr.21656	Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel‚ÄêAviv University, Tel‚ÄêAviv, Israel|Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel‚ÄêAviv University, Tel‚ÄêAviv, Israel	('Israel', 2)

Clinical and CT features in pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection: Different points from adults	Xia, Wei; Shao, Jianbo; Guo, Yu; Peng, Xuehua; Li, Zhen; Hu, Daoyu	Abstract Purpose To discuss the different characteristics of clinical, laboratory, and chest computed tomography (CT) in pediatric patients from adults with 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. Methods The clinical, laboratory, and chest CT features of 20 pediatric inpatients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test were retrospectively analyzed during 23 January and 8 February 2020. The clinical and laboratory information was obtained from inpatient records. All the patients were undergone chest CT in our hospital. Results Thirteen pediatric patients (13/20, 65%) had an identified history of close contact with COVID-19 diagnosed family members. Fever (12/20, 60%) and cough (13/20, 65%) were the most common symptoms. For laboratory findings, procalcitonin elevation (16/20, 80%) should be pay attention to, which is not common in adults. Coinfection (8/20, 40%) is common in pediatric patients. A total of 6 patients presented with unilateral pulmonary lesions (6/20, 30%), 10 with bilateral pulmonary lesions (10/20, 50%), and 4 cases showed no abnormality on chest CT (4/20, 20%). Consolidation with surrounding halo sign was observed in 10 patients (10/20, 50%), ground-glass opacities were observed in 12 patients (12/20, 60%), fine mesh shadow was observed in 4 patients (4/20, 20%), and tiny nodules were observed in 3 patients (3/20, 15%). Conclusion Procalcitonin elevation and consolidation with surrounding halo signs were common in pediatric patients which were different from adults. It is suggested that underlying coinfection may be more common in pediatrics, and the consolidation with surrounding halo sign which is considered as a typical sign in pediatric patients.	2020	NA	Pediatric Pulmonology	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/ppul.24718	4844	#4404	Xia 2020	NA	* Case study/series; * Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Infection prevention and control	10.1002/ppul.24718	Department of Imaging Center, Wuhan Children's Hospital (Wuhan Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital), Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Imaging Center, Wuhan Children's Hospital (Wuhan Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital), Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Imaging Center, Wuhan Children's Hospital (Wuhan Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital), Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Imaging Center, Wuhan Children's Hospital (Wuhan Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital), Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Imaging Center, Wuhan Children's Hospital (Wuhan Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital), Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Imaging Center, Wuhan Children's Hospital (Wuhan Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital), Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Imaging Center, Wuhan Children's Hospital (Wuhan Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital), Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Imaging Center, Wuhan Children's Hospital (Wuhan Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital), Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China	('China', 12)
CHINA'S OLDEST CORONAVIRUS SURVIVORS	Huang, Yan-Mei; Hong, Xue-Zhi; Shen, Jian; Huang, Yi; Zhao, Hai-Lu	The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVIDâ€19) represents a global human pandemic. As of March 16, 2020, 167,515 cases were reported in 151 countries and regions. The death toll worldwide has reached 6,606, far exceeding the fatalities of two other coronavirus diseasesâ€”severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)â€”combined.1 Clinical studies consistently show that critical conditions and deaths associated with COVIDâ€19 occurred particularly in older adults, especially those with chronic multimorbidity.2, 3 Extraordinarily, five older patients aged 98 years and over were discharged from hospitals, four of whom were in Wuhanâ€”the epicenter of the global outbreak. Here we present their successful stories to inspire medical staff, patients, and the public. The first case was the oldest so far reported. A 103â€yearâ€old woman who had a confirmed positive nucleic acid test result for COVIDâ€19 on March 1 was admitted to the Liâ€Yuan Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.4 She was bedridden with preexisting Alzheimer's disease and other comorbidities. Ward physicians and nurses tried hard to communicate with her accurately. Computed tomography (CT) imaging proved pleural effusion. Her condition was severe at admission yet improved with nurses' care and supportive treatments. She became nucleic acid negative on March 6 and returned home two days later. The second patient was a 98â€yearâ€old woman who presented with constant fever (>38.5Â°C) and fatigue on February 3.5 She lived with her 79â€yearâ€old daughter, and her 49â€yearâ€old granddaughter, who lived elsewhere, joined them for the Chinese Spring Festival. The three women showed COVIDâ€19 pneumonia as confirmed by CT scan and nucleic acid tests. They were admitted to the Wuhan First Hospital and shared a ward on February 13. After 10 more days of supportive therapies and individualized nutritional supplementation, the 98â€yearâ€old woman, together with her daughter and granddaughter, was confirmed to be COVIDâ€19â€free and was thus released the same day on March 3. The third case was also a 98â€yearâ€old woman who had a high body temperature > 40Â°C in early February.5 Considering her critically ill condition, she and her 55â€yearâ€old daughter, who also had the virus, were transferred to an intensive care unit in a makeshift hospital on the evening of February 13; they were discharged on March 1. The major treatments included antiâ€infection medication, intensive nursing care, and nutritional supplementation. Despite her heart failure, she was joyfully all cleared from the severe lung infection. The fourth case who recovered from the coronavirus infection was a 98â€yearâ€old bishop.6 The pastor was diagnosed with COVIDâ€19 pneumonia on February 3 and treated at the Central Hospital in Nanyang, Henan province, which shares its border with Hubei, the province at the heart of the epidemic. He has tested negative since February 12 and was discharged two days later. In addition to the viral infection, the bishop had comorbidities such as arrhythmia and pleural effusions. He was treated with a thoracic drainage catheter and his recovery was exceptional. The last infected patient was a 101â€yearâ€old man who spent a week in the Wuhan Third Hospital.7 He became unwell in February and was immediately hospitalized after being diagnosed with the viral infection. His doctor claimed that the determined pensioner had concentrated on getting better soon so he could go home and take care of his 92â€yearâ€old wife. During hospitalization, the 101â€yearâ€old gentleman insisted on taking care of himself and was always the first to get up early for a morning walk. He clearly knew that â€œIt is no bother and I can just do it.â€ Thanks to the significant commitment, hard work, and intensive care from the frontline medical staff and the Chinese government, these five oldest patients clearly show that age is definitely not a barrier to recovering from the nfection. These successful stories are indeed a joy to the world: Joy can be â€œinfectiousâ€ and â€œpandemicâ€ too.	2020	NA	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/jgs.16462	45112	#42080	Huang 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/jgs.16462	Department of Immunology, Guangxi Area of Excellence, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Department of Geriatrics, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200032 China|Department of Immunology, Guangxi Area of Excellence, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541001 China|Department of Immunology, Guangxi Area of Excellence, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Department of Immunology, Guangxi Area of Excellence, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Department of Immunology, Guangxi Area of Excellence, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Department of Immunology, Guangxi Area of Excellence, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Department of Geriatrics, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200032 China|Department of Immunology, Guangxi Area of Excellence, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541001 China|Department of Immunology, Guangxi Area of Excellence, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Department of Immunology, Guangxi Area of Excellence, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Department of Immunology, Guangxi Area of Excellence, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China|Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, 541100 China	('China', 24)
Immune responses and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 during an outbreak in Iran: Comparison with SARS and MERS	Rokni, Mohsen; Ghasemi, Vida; Tavakoli, Zahra	Summary The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19, an outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, an important pathogen for humans. There is an urgent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In Iran, the first case of the COVID-19 was reported after spread from China and other countries. Fever, cough, and fatigue were the most common symptoms of this virus. In worldwide, the incubation period of COVID-19 was 3 to 7?days and approximately 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe, requiring oxygen, and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. To mount an antiviral response, the innate immune system recognizes molecular structures that are produced by the invasion of the virus. COVID-19 infection induces IgG antibodies against N protein that can be detected by serum as early as day 4 after the onset of disease and with most patients seroconverting by day 14. Laboratory evidence of clinical patients showed that a specific T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 is important for the recognition and killing of infected cells, particularly in the lungs of infected individuals. At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19 and the main treatments are supportive. In this review, we investigated the innate and acquired immune responses in patients who recovered from COVID-19, which could inform the design of prophylactic vaccines and immunotherapy for the future.	2020	NA	Reviews in Medical Virology	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/rmv.2107	45188	#42032	Rokni 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/rmv.2107	Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran|Department of Immunology, Buali Hospital of Laboratory, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran|Department of Virology, School of Medicine, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khoramabad, Iran|Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran|Department of Immunology, Buali Hospital of Laboratory, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran|Department of Virology, School of Medicine, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khoramabad, Iran	('Iran', 6)
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on urology residency training in Italy	Amparore, Daniele; Claps, Francesco; Cacciamani, Giovanni E.; Esperto, Francesco; Fiori, Cristian; Liguori, Giovanni; Serni, Sergio; Trombetta, Carlo; Carini, Marco; Porpiglia, Francesco; Checcucci, Enrico; Campi, Riccardo	In the global emergency scenario caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the Urology residents' training might be critically affected. To provide insights on this issue, a 25-items online Survey was sent to all Italian residents one month after the first case of COVID-19 in Italy, to evaluate their routine involvement in "clinical" (on-call duty, outpatient visits, diagnostic procedures) and "surgical" (endoscopic, open and minimally invasive surgery) training activities before and during the COVID-19 period. Overall, 351/577 (60.8%) residents completed the Survey. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of residents routinely involved in "clinical" and "surgical" activities ranged from 79.8% to 87.2% and from 49.3% to 73.5%, respectively. In the COVID-19 period, the proportion of residents experiencing a severe reduction (>40%) or complete suppression (>80%) of training exposure ranged between 41.1% and 81.2% for "clinical" activities while between 44.2% and 62.1% for "surgical" activities. This reduction was even more pronounced for residents attending the final year of training. Our study is the first to provide real-life data on how Urology residency training can be impaired during an emergency period. To address this challenge, strategies aiming to increase the use of telemedicine, smart learning programs and tele-mentoring of surgical procedures, are warranted.	2020	NA	Minerva urologica e nefrologica = The Italian journal of urology and nephrology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.23736/S0393-2249.20.03868-0	37778	#38350	Amparore 2020	NA	NA	10.23736/S0393-2249.20.03868-0	Department of In Vitro Toxicology and Dermato-Cosmetology (IVTD), Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090, Brussels, Belgium|Department of Microbiology, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 101, 1090, Brussels, Belgium	('Belgium', 2)

68 Consecutive patients assessed for COVID-19 infection; experience from a UK regional infectious disease unit	Easom, Nicholas; Moss, Peter; Barlow, Gavin; Samson, Anda; Taynton, Thomas; Adams, Kate; Ivan, Monica; Burns, Phillipa; Gajee, Kavitha; Eastick, Kirstine; Lillie, Patrick J.	BACKGROUND: Assessment of possible infection with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 illness, has been a major activity of infection services since the first reports of cases in December 2019. We report a series of 68 patients assessed at a Regional Infection Unit in the UK. METHODS: Between the 29(th) Jan 2020 - 24(th) Feb 2020 demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We compared clinical features between patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment. RESULTS: Patients assessed were aged from 0-76 years, 36/68 were female. Peaks of clinical assessments coincided with updates to the case definition for suspected COVID-19. Microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2, Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses and rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 received antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted, 5 due to inability to self-isolate. Patients requiring admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were more likely to have fever or raised respiratory rate compared to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients had mild illness, which did not require clinical intervention. This finding supports a community testing approach, supported by clinicians able to review more unwell patients. Extensions of the epidemiological criteria for the case definition of suspected COVID-19 lead to increased screening intensity, strategies must be in place to accommodate this in time for forthcoming changes as the epidemic develops.	2020	NA	Influenza and other respiratory viruses	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/irv.12739	19074	#19687	Easom 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/irv.12739	Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK|Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK	('UK', 22)

A quickly, effectively screening process of novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children in Shanghai, China	Shi, Y.; Wang, X.; Liu, G.; Zhu, Q.; Wang, J.; Yu, H.; Wang, C.; Wang, L.; Zhang, M.; Zhang, L.; Lu, G.; Lu, Z.; Yu, J.; Qiao, Z.; Gu, Y.; Shen, G.; Xu, H.; Zeng, M.; Zhai, X.; Huang, G.	Background: A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in China was caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the screening and diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in our hospital. Methods: Developed a procedure for the identification of children cases with COVID-19 in outpatient and emergency department of our hospital, then we observed how this process works. Results: (I) There were 56 cases considered suspected cases, and 10 cases were confirmed as COVID-19. (II) Of the 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in our hospital, 5 were males and 5 were females, aged from 7 months to 11 years, the average age is 6.0Â±4.2 years, 6 cases were mild pneumonia, the others were upper respiratory tract infection. (III) We followed up 68 patients in isolation at home until symptoms disappeared. Non were missed in the patient's first visit. The sensitivity of this method is 100% and the specificity is 71.3%. Conclusions: Our screening process works well, and it is also necessary to establish a screening network in the hospital.	2020	NA	Annals of Translational Medicine	8	5	NA	NA	10.21037/atm.2020.03.22	34557	#34839	Shi 2020	NA	NA	10.21037/atm.2020.03.22	Department of Infectious Disease, |Department of Hospital Infection Control, |Department of Respiration, |Department of Critical Care Medicine, |Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, |Department of Medical Image, |Department of Nursing, |Department of Nephrology/Rheumatology, |Department of Hematology/Oncology, 	NA

COVID-19 in the Shadows of MERS-CoV in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia	Memish, Mazin Barry; Maha Al, Amri; Ziad, A.	Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has plagued the Middle East since it was first reported in 2012. Recently, at the end of December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, linked to a wet seafood market with a new coronavirus identified as the etiologic agent currently named SARS-CoV-2. Most cases are in Mainland China with international spread to 25 countries. The novelty of the virus, the rapid national and international spread, and the lack of therapeutic and preventative strategies have led the WHO International Health Regulation emergency committee to declare the disease as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. As it relates to countries with the ongoing MERS-CoV community cases and hospital acquired infections, there will be a huge challenge for HCWs to deal with both coronaviruses, especially with the lack of standardized and approved point of care testing. This challenge will now be faced by the whole global health community dealing with COVID-19 since both coronaviruses have similar presentation. Those patients should now be tested for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, and with the continuing wide international spread of SARS-CoV-2, the travel history to China in the last 14 days will be of less significance	2020	NA	Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health	10	1	NA	NA	10.2991/jegh.k.200218.003	2537	#2899	Memish 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Other related diseases and viruses	10.2991/jegh.k.200218.003	Department of Infectious Disease, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia|College of Medicine, Alfaisal University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia	('Saudi Arabia', 2)
Persistence and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patients	Ling, Yun; Xu, Shui-Bao; Lin, Yi-Xiao; Tian, Di; Zhu, Zhao-Qin; Dai, Fa-Hui; Wu, Fan; Song, Zhi-Gang; Huang, Wei; Chen, Jun; Hu, Bi-Jie; Wang, Sheng; Mao, En-Qiang; Zhu, Lei; Zhang, Wen-Hong; Lu, Hong-Zhou	Background: A patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta. The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence. Methods: The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patientsâ€™ oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. Results: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0â€“62.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, patientsâ€™ inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0â€“11.0) days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patientsâ€™ stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0â€“16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0â€“4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patientsâ€™ urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (Fâ€Š=â€Š2.669, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.044, and adjusted R2â€Š=â€Š0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patientsâ€™ stools (tâ€Š=â€Šâˆ’2.699, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; tâ€Š=â€Š2.550, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; tâ€Š=â€Š4.631, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (Pâ€Š>â€Š0.05). Conclusions: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patientsâ€™ stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.

Clinical findings in a group of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) outside of Wuhan, China: retrospective case series	Xu, Xiao-Wei; Wu, Xiao-Xin; Jiang, Xian-Gao; Xu, Kai-Jin; Ying, Ling-Jun; Ma, Chun-Lian; Li, Shi-Bo; Wang, Hua-Ying; Zhang, Sheng; Gao, Hai-Nv; Sheng, Ji-Fang; Cai, Hong-Liu; Qiu, Yun-Qing; Li, Lan-Juan	Objective To study the clinical characteristics of patients in Zhejiang province, China, infected with the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-2019).Design Retrospective case series.Setting Seven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China.Participants 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection. Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020.Main outcome measures Clinical data, collected using a standardised case report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, incubation period. If information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patient for clarification.Results Of the 62 patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no patients died during the study. According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%). Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days.Conclusion As of early February 2020, compared with patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are relatively mild.	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m606	NA	10.1136/bmj.m606	63	#1262	Xu 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1136/bmj.m606	Department of Infectious Disease, Wenzhou Central Hospital, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China|Department of Infectious Disease, Taizhou Enze Medical Centre (Group), Enze Hospital, Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China|Department of Infectious Disease, First People‚Äôs Hospital of Wenling, Wenling, Zhejiang Province, China|Department of Infectious Disease, Affiliated Zhoushan Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Yinzhou People‚Äôs Hospital, Affiliated Yinzhou Hospital, College of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, China|Department of Infectious Disease, Taizhou Hospital, Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China|Department of Infectious Disease, ShuLan (Hangzhou) Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang Shuren University Shulan International Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care Medicine	('China', 7)
Analysis of clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of 95 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a retrospective analysis	Zhang, Gemin; Zhang, Jie; Wang, Bowen; Zhu, Xionglin; Wang, Qiang; Qiu, Shiming	Since December 2019, 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China and even the world. We sought to analyse the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of some cases with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia . In this retrospective study, we extracted the data on 95 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan Xinzhou District Peopleâ€™s Hospital from January 16th to February 25th, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and abnormal radiologic findings. Outcomes were followed up until March 2th, 2020. Higher temperature, blood leukocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage, C-reactive protein level, D-dimer level, alanine aminotransferase activity, aspartate aminotransferase activity, Î± - hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity, lactate dehydrogenase activity and creatine kinase activity were related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint, and so were lower lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage and total protein level. Age below 40 or above 60â€‰years old, male, higher Creatinine level, and lower platelet count also seemed related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint, however the P values were greater than 0.05, which mean under the same condition studies of larger samples are needed in the future. Multiple factors were related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint, and more related studies are needed in the future.	2020	NA	Respiratory Research	21	1	74-74	NA	10.1186/s12931-020-01338-8	17596	#18192	Zhang 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology	10.1186/s12931-020-01338-8	Department of infectious disease, Wuhan Xinzhou District People‚Äôs Hospital, Wuhan, China|Department of Neurology, Wuhan Xinzhou District People‚Äôs Hospital, 61 Xinzhou street, Xinzhou District, Wuhan, 430000, Hubei Province, China|Department of critical care medicine, Wuhan Xinzhou District People‚Äôs Hospital, Wuhan, China	('China', 3)
MERS, SARS and other coronaviruses as causes of pneumonia	Yin, Yudong; Wunderink, Richard G.	Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been considered to be relatively harmless respiratory pathogens in the past. However, after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), HCoVs have received worldwide attention as important pathogens in respiratory tract infection. This review focuses on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical characteristics among SARS-coronaviruses (CoV), MERS-CoV and other HCoV infections.	2018	NA	Respirology	23	2	130-137	29052924	10.1111/resp.13196	913	#1349	Yin 2018	NA	* Narrative review; Other related diseases and viruses	10.1111/resp.13196	Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Beijing Chao‚ÄêYang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China|Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Beijing Chao‚ÄêYang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China	('China', 2)
Questions raised by COVID-19 case descriptions	Britton, Philip N.; Marais, Ben J.	The recent emergence and rapid spread of COVIDâ€19 in Wuhan, China pose an ongoing global challenge. An intriguing observation has been the near absence of children in initial disease reports, mild disease overall in child cases, no reported deaths in children aged <10 years of age and suggestions that minimally symptomatic children may facilitate disease transmission within communities.1-6 Li et al. report three child cases of confirmed COVIDâ€19 infection7; the report is notable for at least two reasons. Firstly, the report describes a mild disease course amongst young children with no symptoms of respiratory distress, no clinical indication for hospitalisation, minimal changes on chest computed tomography and complete recovery in the short term. This raises multiple questions such as: (i) whether the low frequency of confirmed COVIDâ€19 infections in children reflects case detection bias due to attenuated disease severity in children; (ii) whether undiagnosed child infections contribute to community transmission; (iii) the biological basis for the attenuated disease severity, if this is indeed the case; and (iv) the role of existing coâ€morbidity in children, given indications that â€“ as well as older age â€“ coâ€morbidity is a major determinant of disease severity in adults.2, 8 Secondly, the report describes the use of nebulised interferonâ€Î± in two cases, with to our knowledge no data on efficacy and limited information on safety, while nebulisation poses a transmission risk in healthcare environments, as observed with the nearly identical SARS coronavirus.9 While the use of novel/experimental therapies may be justified in a desperate situation, every indication is that this is not required in young children with minimal symptoms. The imperative to â€˜do anything possibleâ€™ will be felt by all paediatricians caring for children with COVIDâ€19; however, the â€˜first do no harmâ€™ principle should certainly apply in all situations where the natural history of disease is poorly described or indicative of likely spontaneous recovery without any treatment. Clinicians should always balance potential risks and benefits to the individual patient with assiduous attention to infection control to protect other vulnerable patients within the healthâ€care environment and the public at large. The report by Li et al.7 is valuable given the scant information available on children with COVIDâ€19, but detailed case descriptions with better documentation of the full disease course would have been more informative. Paediatricians around the world should endeavour to collect comprehensive clinical data and biological specimens including longitudinal sampling from cases wherever they occur in order to further our understanding of the clinical features, pathogenesis of disease and host response in children infected with COVIDâ€19.	2020	NA	Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/jpc.14872	12331	#11543	Britton 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Epidemiology	10.1111/jpc.14872	Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia|Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia|Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia|Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia	('Australia', 4)
Organ-protective Effect of Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 and its Effect on the Prognosis of COVID-19	Cheng, Hao; Wang, Yan; Wang, Gui-Qiang	This article reviews the correlation between ACE2 and severe risk factors for COVID-19 and the possible mechanisms. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The classical RAS ACE-Ang II-AT1R regulatory axis and the ACE2-Ang1-7-MasR counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in humans. ACE2 is widely distributed in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and testes. ACE2 antagonizes the activation of the classical RAS system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also uses the ACE2 receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells. ARDS is a clinical high-mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury. Current research shows that the poor prognosis of patients with COVID-19 is related to factors such as sex (male), age (higher than 60 years), underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), secondary ARDS, and other relevant factors. Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on chronic underlying diseases and ARDS, the development of spike protein-based vaccine and drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the future.

A systematic review of lopinavir therapy for SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus-A possible reference for coronavirus disease-19 treatment option Audio Interview: Preparing for the Spread of Covid-19	Yao, T. T.; Qian, J. D.; Zhu, W. Y.; Wang, Y.; Wang, G. Q.; Rubin, E. J.; Baden, L. R.; Morrissey, S.	In the past few decades, coronaviruses have risen as a global threat to public health. Currently, the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from Wuhan caused a worldwide panic. There are no specific antiviral therapies for COVID-19. However, there are agents that were used during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics. We could learn from SARS and MERS. Lopinavir (LPV) is an effective agent that inhibits the protease activity of coronavirus. In this review, we discuss the literature on the efficacy of LPV in vitro and in vivo, especially in patients with SARS and MERS, so that we might clarify the potential for the use of LPV in patients with COVID-19.	2020	NA	Journal of medical virology The New England journal of medicine	382	9	e18	32101683	10.1002/jmv.25729 10.1056/NEJMe2003319	14329	#13367	Yao 2020	NA	* Systematic review; Other related diseases and viruses	10.1002/jmv.25729	Department of Infectious Diseases and the Center for Liver Diseases, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Infectious Diseases and the Center for Liver Diseases, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Infectious Diseases and the Center for Liver Diseases, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Infectious Diseases and the Center for Liver Diseases, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Infectious Diseases and the Center for Liver Diseases, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Infectious Diseases and the Center for Liver Diseases, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Infectious Diseases and the Center for Liver Diseases, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Infectious Diseases and the Center for Liver Diseases, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Infectious Diseases and the Center for Liver Diseases, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Department of Infectious Diseases and the Center for Liver Diseases, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China|Institution	('China', 10)

A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF INSTRUCTOR-LED TRAINING VERSUS VIDEO LESSON IN TRAINING HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN PROPER DONNING AND DOFFING OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT	Christensen, Liva; Rasmussen, Charlotte Schang; Benfield, Thomas; Franc, Jeffrey Michael	ObjectiveThis study compared live instructor-led training in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) donning and doffing with video-based instruction. It assessed the difference in performance between (i) attending one instructor-led training session in donning and doffing PPE one month prior to assessment, and (ii) watching training videos over the month.MethodsThis randomized controlled trial pilot study divided 21 medical students and junior doctors into 2 groups. Control group participants attended one instructor-led training session. Video group participants watched training videos demonstrating the same procedures, which they could freely watch again at home. After one month, a doctor performed a blind evaluation of performance using checklists.Results19 participants were assessed after one month. The mean donning score was 84.8/100 for the instructor-led group and 88/100 for the video group; mean effect size 3,2 (95%CI: -7,5 to 9,5). The mean doffing score was 79.1/100 for the instructor group and 73.9/100 for the video group; mean effect size 5,2 (95%CI: -7,6 to 18).ConclusionOur study found no significant difference in donning and doffing score between instructor-led and video lessons. Video training could be a fast and resource-efficient method of training in PPE donning and doffing in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.

To date, there are no proven options for prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, nor therapy for those who develop COVID-19. Immune (i.e. "convalescent") plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals, following resolution of infection and development of antibodies. Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy to confer immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. There are numerous examples, where convalescent plasma has been used successfully as post-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of infectious diseases, including other outbreaks of coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS]). Convalescent plasma has also been used in the COVID-19 pandemic; limited data from China suggest clinical benefit, including radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads and improved survival. Globally, blood centers have robust infrastructure to undertake collections and construct inventories of convalescent plasma to meet the growing demand. Nonetheless, there are nuanced challenges, both regulatory and logistical, spanning donor eligibility, donor recruitment, collections and transfusion itself. Data from rigorously controlled clinical trials of convalescent plasma are also few, underscoring the need to evaluate its use objectively for a range of indications (e.g., prevention vs treatment) and patient populations (e.g., age, comorbid disease). We provide an overview of convalescent plasma, from evidence of benefit, regulatory considerations, logistical work flow and proposed clinical trials, as scale up is brought underway to mobilize this critical resource. â€ƒ.	2020	NA	The Journal of clinical investigation	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1172/JCI138745	37781	#38467	Bloch 2020	NA	NA	10.1172/JCI138745	Department of Infectious Diseases, Johns Hopkins

The Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 â€“ What's Next for China	Lu, Hongzhou; Stratton, Charles W.; Tang, Yi-Wei	Abstract When an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology occurred in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China in December of 2019, the mystery1 was the nature of the causative agent. Because many of the patients had visited a fish and wild animal market, the possibility of a recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) needed to be investigated2. Finally, could this outbreak of pneumonia be caused by a novel coronavirus that was different from those causing SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)3?

COVID-19 in a Designated Infectious Diseases Hospital Outside Hubei Province, China	Cai, Qingxian; Huang, Deliang; Ou, Pengcheng; Yu, Hong; Zhu, Zhibin; Xia, Zhang; Su, Yinan; Ma, Zhenghua; Zhang, Yiming; Li, Zhiwei; He, Qing; Liu, Lei; Fu, Yang; Chen, Jun	BACKGROUND: The clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) patients outside the epicenter of Hubei province are less understood. METHODS: We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of all COVID-2019 cases in the only referral hospital in Shenzhen city, China from January 11, 2020 to February 6, 2020 and followed until March 6, 2020. RESULTS: Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233 (81.5%) had been to Hubei while 42 (14%) did not have a clear travel history. Only 192(64.4%) cases had a fever as the initial symptom. Compared to the non-severe cases, severe cases were associated with older age, those with underlying diseases, as well as higher levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Slower clearance of the virus was associated with a higher risk of progression to critical condition. As of March 6, 2020, 268 (89.9%) patients were discharged and the overall case fatality ratio was 1.0%. CONCLUSIONS: In a designated hospital outside Hubei Province, COVID-2019 patients could be effectively managed by properly using the existing hospital system. Mortality may be lowered when cases are relatively mild and there are sufficient medical resources to care and treat the disease.	2020	NA	Allergy	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/all.14309	26652	#27762	Cai 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/all.14309	Department of Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen People‚Äôs Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China|Department of Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen People‚Äôs Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China	('China', 2)
The establishment of reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 and variation analysis	Wang, Changtai; Liu, Zhongping; Chen, Zixiang; Huang, Xin; Xu, Mengyuan; He, Tengfei; Zhang, Zhenhua	Starting around December 2019, an epidemic of pneumonia, which was named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO), broke out in Wuhan, China, and is spreading throughout the world. A new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) was soon found to be the cause. At present, the sensitivity of clinical nucleic acid detection is limited, and it is still unclear whether it is related to genetic variation. In this study, we retrieved 95 full-length genomic sequences of SARAS-CoV-2 strains from the NCBI and GISAID databases, established the reference sequence by conducting multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses, and analyzed sequence variations along the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The homology among all viral strains was generally high, among them 99.99% (99.91%-100%) at the nucleotide level, 99.99% (99.79%-100%) at the amino acid level. Although overall variation in ORF regions is low, 13 variation sites in 1a, 1b, S, 3a, M, 8, and N regions were identified, among which positions nt28144 in ORF 8 and nt8782 in ORF 1a showed mutation rate of 30.53% (29/95) and 29.47% (28/95) respectively. These findings suggested that there may be selective mutations in SARS-COV-2, and it is necessary to avoid certain regions when designing primers and probes. Establishment of the reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 could benefit not only biological study of this virus but also diagnosis, clinical monitoring and intervention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the future.

Liver injury during highly pathogenic human coronavirus infections	Xu, Ling; Liu, Jia; Lu, Mengji; Yang, Dongliang; Zheng, Xin	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), the pathogen of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has posed a serious threat to global public health. The WHO has declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection an international public health emergency. Lung lesions have been considered as the major damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, liver injury has also been reported to occur during the course of the disease in severe cases. Similarly, previous studies have shown that liver damage was common in the patients infected by the other two highly pathogenic coronavirus - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and associated with the severity of diseases. In this review, the characteristics and mechanism of liver injury caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection were summarized, which may provide help for further studies on the liver injury of COVID-19.	2020	NA	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	NA	NA	10.1111/liv.14435-10.1111/liv.14435	NA	10.1111/liv.14435	8740	#8527	Xu 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/liv.14435	Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg‚ÄêEssen, Essen, Germany|Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg‚ÄêEssen, Essen, Germany|Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China	('China', 8)|('Germany', 2)

Protecting healthcare personnel from 2019-nCoV infection risks: lessons and suggestions	Zhang, Zhiruo; Liu, Shelan; Xiang, Mi; Li, Shijian; Zhao, Dahai; Huang, Chaolin; Chen, Saijuan	The outbreak of a novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19, caused by the 2019-nCoV infection) in December 2019 is one of the most severe public health emergencies since the founding of Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in 1949. Healthcare personnel (HCP) nationwide are facing heavy workloads and high risk of infection, especially those who care for patients at the epicenter of the outbreak, Hubei Province. Sadly, as of February 20, 2020, over two thousand COVID-19 cases are confirmed among HCP from 476 hospitals nationwide, with nearly 90% of them from Hubei Province. Based on literature search and interviews with some HCP working at Wuhan, capital city of Hubei, we have summarized some of the effective measures taken to reduce infection among HCP, and also made suggestions for improving occupational safety during an infectious disease outbreak. The experience and lessons learned should be a valuable asset for international health community to contain the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic around the world.	2020	NA	Frontiers of Medicine	NA	NA	3-Jan	NA	10.1007/s11684-020-0765-x	16024	#15124	Zhang 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Infection prevention and control	10.1007/s11684-020-0765-x	Department of Infectious Diseases, Zhejiang Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Hangzhou, 310000, China|Department of Public Health, SUNY College at Old Westbury, Old Westbury, NY, 11568, USA|Department of Infectious Diseases, Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, 430030, China	('China', 2)|('USA', 1)

How to perform lung ultrasound in pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 infection	Moro, F.; Buonsenso, D.; Moruzzi, M. C.; Inchingolo, R.; Smargiassi, A.; Demi, L.; Larici, A. R.; Scambia, G.; Lanzone, A.; Testa, A. C.	Abstract Under specific circumstances, such as during the current COVID-19 outbreak, pregnant women can be a target for respiratory infection, and lung examination may be required as part of their clinical evaluation, ideally avoiding exposure to radiation.

Analyzing Situational Awareness through Public Opinion to Predict Adoption of Social Distancing Amid Pandemic COVID-19	Qazi, Atika; Qazi, Javaria; Naseer, Khulla; Zeeshan, Muhammad; Hardaker, Glenn; Maitama, Jaafar Zubairu; Haruna, Khalid	COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. People's response towards social distancing in the emerging pandemic is uncertain. In this study, we evaluated the influence of information (formal and informal) sources on situational awareness of the public for adopting health-protective behaviors such as social distancing. For this purpose, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted. The hypothesis proposed suggests that adoption of social distancing practices is an outcome of situational awareness which is achieved by the information sources. Results suggest that information sources formal (p=0.001) and informal (p=0.007) were found to be significantly related to perceived understanding. Findings also indicate that social distancing is significantly influenced by situational awareness p=0.000. It can, therefore, be concluded that increase situational awareness in times of public health crisis using formal information sources can significantly increase the adoption of protective health behavior and in turn contain the spread of infectious diseases.

Diabetes is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of COVID-19	Guo, Weina; Li, Mingyue; Dong, Yalan; Zhou, Haifeng; Zhang, Zili; Tian, Chunxia; Qin, Renjie; Wang, Haijun; Shen, Yin; Du, Keye; Zhao, Lei; Fan, Heng; Luo, Shanshan; Hu, Desheng	ABSTRACT Aim To figure out whether diabetes is a risk factor influencing the progression and prognosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Materials and Methods A total of 174 consecutive patients confirmed with COVID-19 were studied. Demographic data, medical history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) as well we treatment measures were collected and analyzed. Results We found that COVID-19 patients without other comorbidities but with diabetes (n=24) were at higher risk of severe pneumonia, release of tissue injury-related enzymes, excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism. Furthermore, serum levels of inflammation related biomarkers such as IL-6, C-reactive protein, serum ferritine and coagulation index, D-dimer, were significantly higher (p<?0.01) in diabetic patients compared with those without, suggesting that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to an inflammatory storm eventually leading to rapid deterioration of COVID-19. Conclusions Our data support the notion that diabetes should be considered as a risk factor for a rapid progression and bad prognosis of COVID-19. More intensive attention should be paid to patients with diabetes, in case of rapid deterioration. This article is protected by copyright.

A highly conserved cryptic epitope in the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV	Yuan, Meng; Wu, Nicholas C.; Zhu, Xueyong; Lee, Chang-Chun D.; So, Ray T. Y.; Lv, Huibin; Mok, Chris K. P.; Wilson, Ian A.	The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has now become a pandemic, but there is currently very little understanding of the antigenicity of the virus. We therefore determined the crystal structure of CR3022, a neutralizing antibody previously isolated from a convalescent SARS patient, in complex with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to 3.1 Ã…. CR3022 targets a highly conserved epitope, distal from the receptor-binding site, that enables cross-reactive binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Structural modeling further demonstrates that the binding epitope can only be accessed by CR3022 when at least two RBD on the trimeric S protein are in the â€œupâ€ conformation and slightly rotated. Overall, this study provides molecular insights into antibody recognition of SARS-CoV-2.	2020	NA	Science	NA	NA	eabb7269	NA	10.1126/science.abb7269	30593	#31567	Yuan 2020	NA	NA	10.1126/science.abb7269	Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.|Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.|Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.|Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.|Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.|Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.

Stability Issues of RT-PCR Testing of SARS-CoV-2 for Hospitalized Patients Clinically Diagnosed with COVID-19	Li, Yafang; Yao, Lin; Li, Jiawei; Chen, Lei; Song, Yiyan; Cai, Zhifang; Yang, Chunhua	Abstract In this study, we collected a total of 610 hospitalized patients from Wuhan between Feb 2, 2020, and Feb 17, 2020. We reported a potentially high false negtive rate of RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the 610 hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the 2019 outbreak. We also found that the RT-PCR results from several tests at different points were variable from the same patients during the course of diagnosis and treatment of these patients. Our results indicate that in addition to the emphasis on RT-PCR testing, clinical indicators such as CT images should also be used not only for diagnosis and treatment but also for isolation, recovery/discharge and transferring for hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the current epidemic. These results suggested the urgent needs for standard of procedures(SOP) of sampling from different anatomic sites, sample transportation, optimization of RT-PCR, serology diagnosis/screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and distinct diagnosis from other respiratory diseases such as fluenza infections as well.

How is COVID-19 affecting South Korea? What is our current strategy?	Her, Minyoung	The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 is expanding globally. South Korea is one of the countries most affected by COVID-19 from the very early stages of this pandemic. Explosive outbreaks occurred across South Korea in the first two months, and efforts to control this new virus have involved everyone across the country. To curb the transmission of the virus, health care professionals, committees, and governments have combined many approaches, such as extensive COVID-19 screening, effective patient triage, the transparent provision of information, and the use of information technology. This experience could provide some valuable ideas and lessons to others who are fighting against COVID-19.	2020	NA	Disaster medicine and public health preparedness	NA	NA	7-Jan	NA	10.1017/dmp.2020.69	30709	#31086	Her 2020	NA	NA	10.1017/dmp.2020.69	Department of Internal Medicine, |Department of Internal Medicine, 	NA

Effect of isolation practice on the transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus among hemodialysis patients: A 2-year prospective cohort study	Park, Hayne Cho; Lee, Sang-Ho; Kim, Juhee; Kim, Do Hyoung; Cho, AJin; Jeon, Hee Jung; Oh, Jieun; Noh, Jung-Woo; Jeong, Da-Wun; Kim, Yang-Gyun; Lee, Chang-Hee; Yoo, Kyung Don; Lee, Young-Ki	Hemodialysis (HD) patients had a high rate of infection transmission and mortality during the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in Saudi Arabia. A standardized guideline on isolation technique for exposed HD patients is not available. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of different isolation strategies on the prevention of secondary viral transmission and clinical outcomes among exposed HD patients.During the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea, 116 patients in 3 HD units were incidentally exposed to individuals with confirmed MERS-CoV infection and underwent different types of isolation, which were as follows: single-room isolation (nâ€Š=â€Š54, 47%), cohort isolation (nâ€Š=â€Š46, 40%), and self-imposed quarantine (nâ€Š=â€Š16, 13%). The primary outcome was rate of secondary viral transmission. The secondary outcome measures were changes in clinical and biochemical markers during the isolation period, difference in clinical and biochemical markers according to the types of isolation practice, and effect of isolation practice on patient survival.During a mean isolation period of 15 days, no further cases of secondary transmission were detected among HD patients. Plasma hemoglobin, serum calcium, and serum albumin levels and single-pool Kt/V decreased during the isolation period but normalized thereafter. Patients who were subjected to self-imposed quarantine had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, lower total cholesterol level, and lower Kt/V than those who underwent single-room or cohort isolation. During the 24-month follow-up period, 12 patients died. However, none of the deaths occurred during the isolation period, and no differences were observed in patient survival rate according to different isolation strategies.Although 116 participants in 3 HD units were incidentally exposed to MERS-CoV during the 2015 outbreak in Korea, strict patient surveillance and proper isolation practice prevented secondary transmission of the virus. Thus, a renal disaster protocol, which includes proper contact surveillance and isolation practice, must be established in the future to accommodate the needs of HD patients during disasters or outbreaks.	2020	NA	Medicine (Baltimore)	99	3	e18782-e18782	32011472	10.1097/MD.0000000000018782	601	#287	Park 2020	NA	NA	10.1097/MD.0000000000018782	Department of Internal Medicine, Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital|Department of Internal Medicine, Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong|Department of Internal Medicine, Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul|Department of Anesthesiology, Gangneung Medical Center, Gangneung|Department of Internal Medicine, Ulsan University Hospital, Ulsan, Korea.

Out-of-Hospital Cohort Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients with Mild Symptoms in Korea: an Experience from a Single Community Treatment Center	Park, Peong Gang; Kim, Chang Hyup; Heo, Yoon; Kim, Tae Suk; Park, Chan Woo; Kim, Choong Hyo	The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused a worldwide pandemic. Less than 6 weeks after the first confirmed cases in Korea, the patient number exceeded 5,000, which overcrowded limited hospital resources and forced confirmed patients to stay at home. To allocate medical resources efficiently, Korea implemented a novel institution for the purpose of treating patients with cohort isolation out of hospital, namely the Community Treatment Center (CTC). Herein, we report results of the initial management of patients at one of the largest CTC in Korea. A total of 309 patients were admitted to our CTC. During the first two weeks, 7 patients were transferred to the hospital because of symptom aggravation and 107 patients were discharged without any complication. Although it is a novel concept and may have some limitations, CTC may be a very cost-effective and resource-saving strategy in managing massive cases of COVID-19 or other emerging infectious diseases.	2020	NA	Journal of Korean medical science	35	13	e140-e140	NA	10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e140	30749	#31392	Park 2020	NA	NA	10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e140	Department of Internal Medicine, Kangwon National University Hospital, Chuncheon, Korea.|Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Kangwon National University Hospital, Chuncheon, Korea.|Department of Internal Medicine, Kangwon National University School of Medicine, Chuncheon, Korea.|Department of Emergency Medicine, Kangwon National University School of Medicine, Chuncheon, Korea.|Department of Neurosurgery, Kangwon National University School of Medicine, Chuncheon, Korea.

COVID-19 And Older Adults: What We Know	Shahid, Zainab; Kalayanamitra, Ricci; McClafferty, Brendan; Kepko, Douglas; Ramgobin, Devyani; Patel, Ravi; Aggarwal, Chander Shekher; Vunnam, Rama Rao; Sahu, Nitasa; Bhatt, Dhirisha; Jones, Kirk; Golamari, Reshma; Jain, Rohit	SARS-CoV-2, a novel virus that causes COVID-19 infection, has recently emerged and caused a deadly pandemic. Studies have shown that this virus causes worse outcomes and a higher mortality rate in older adults and those with comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and chronic kidney disease. A significant percentage of older American adults have these diseases, putting them at a higher risk of infection. Additionally, many adults with hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease are placed on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Studies have shown that these medications upregulate the ACE-2 receptor, the very receptor which the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to enter host cells, which puts older adults at a further increased risk of infection. In this review, we discuss the transmission, symptomatology, mortality, and possible treatments for this infection, as they relate to older adults. This article is protected by copyright.

In this retrospective multicenter study, we investigated the clinical course and outcomes of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from early cases in Republic of Korea. METHODS: All of the cases confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction were enrolled from the 1st to the 28th patient nationwide. Clinical data were collected and analyzed for changes in clinical severity including laboratory, radiological, and virologic dynamics during the progression of illness. RESULTS: The median age was 40 years (range, 20-73 years) and 15 (53.6%) patients were male. The most common symptoms were cough (28.6%) and sore throat (28.6%), followed by fever (25.0%). Diarrhea was not common (10.7%). Two patients had no symptoms. Initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed infiltration in 46.4% of the patients, but computed tomography scan confirmed pneumonia in 88.9% (16/18) of the patients. Six patients (21.4%) required supplemental oxygen therapy, but no one needed mechanical ventilation. Lymphopenia was more common in severe cases. Higher level of C-reactive protein and worsening of chest radiographic score was observed during the 5-7 day period after symptom onset. Viral shedding was high from day 1 of illness, especially from the upper respiratory tract (URT). CONCLUSION: The prodromal symptoms of COVID-19 were mild and most patients did not have limitations of daily activity. Viral shedding from URT was high from the prodromal phase. Radiological pneumonia was common from the early days of illness, but it was frequently not evident in simple CXR. These findings could be plausible explanations for the easy and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community.	2020	NA	Journal of Korean medical science	35	13	e142-e142	NA	10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e142	30713	#31389	Kim 2020	NA	NA	10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e142	Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam, Korea.|Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.|Department of Infectious Diseases, Myongji Hospital, Goyang, Korea.|Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.|Department of Internal Medicine, Gyeonggi Provincial Medical Center Ansung Hospital, Anseong, Korea.|Department of Infectious Diseases, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.|Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Chosun University, Gwangju, Korea.|Department of Internal Medicine, Wonkwang University School of Medicine, Iksan, Korea.|Department of Pediatrics, National Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.

Alert for non-respiratory symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in epidemic period: A case report of familial cluster with three asymptomatic COVID-19 patients	Lu, Shubiao; Lin, Jinsong; Zhang, Zhiqiao; Xiao, Liping; Jiang, Zhijian; Chen, Jia; Hu, Chongjing; Luo, Shi	At present, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rampaging around the world. However, asymptomatic carriers intensified the difficulty of prevention and management. Here we reported the screening, clinical feathers, and treatment process of a family cluster involving three COVID-19 patients. The discovery of the first asymptomatic carrier in this family cluster depends on the repeated and comprehensive epidemiological investigation by disease control experts. In addition, the combination of multiple detection methods can help clinicians find asymptomatic carriers as early as possible. In conclusion, the prevention and control experience of this family cluster showed that comprehensive rigorous epidemiological investigation and combination of multiple detection methods were of great value for the detection of hidden asymptomatic carriers.

Continuous Intravenous Anakinra Infusion to Calm the Cytokine Storm in Macrophage Activation Syndrome	Adam Monteagudo, Luke; Boothby, Aaron; Gertner, Elie	OBJECTIVE: To report the benefit of a therapeutic approach consisting of intravenous continuous anakinra (recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) infusions in treating severely ill adult patients with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (sHLH/MAS). METHODS: A retrospective chart review of five patients treated at Regions Hospital from 2016-2019. Demographic, clinical, laboratory characteristics and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Continuous IV anakinra infusions up to 2400 mg/day resulted in rapid serologic, then clinical response in 4/5 severely ill patients who were refractory to all other therapies including subcutaneous anakinra. Subsequently, 3/5 have been maintained on anakinra or canakinumab with no recurrence of MAS. CONCLUSION: Continuous infusion of IV anakinra may result in rapid serologic and subsequent clinical improvement in adult patients with MAS. This method for treating cytokine storm should be considered in the current COVID-19 pandemic in the subgroup of patients with severe disease that have a cytokine storm presentation.	2020	NA	ACR open rheumatology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1002/acr2.11135	45100	#42170	AdamMonteagudo 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/acr2.11135	Department of Internal Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN, USA|Department of Internal Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN, USA	('USA', 2)
Caution should be exercised for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the elderly	YajunYuan; Wang, Nan; Ou, Xueqing	In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China and presented a major threat to public health. Nationwide, there were more than 70,000 confirmed cases, and 2500 deaths. Most patients were elderly, with severe disease. For acute respiratory infection, RT-PCR is routinely used to detect causative viruses in respiratory secretions. Coronavirus RNA can be detected from nose and throat swabs, sputum and other lower respiratory tract secretions, blood and feces. Such specimens were examined by RT-PCR. Three targets, RdRP, E and N genes were detected, indicating samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2]. After patient recovery, a chest CT examination, combined with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, confirmed diagnosis. However, some recovery patients with negative RNA tests turned RNA positive. The preliminary data is about 14% of discharged patients in Guangdong reported by the Guangdong Center for Disease Control (CDC). This is an important scientific issue. If samples are positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, patients should be managed according to infection source. Fortunately, there were no close contacts of second-generation cases. We herein report six SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed in our hospital, for the changes of results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA should attract attention. Most patients were elderly, with a low Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). However, the association of the phenomenon with aging and GNRI has not yet been reported in detail. Further investigations are necessary to confirm and improve these findings. Similarly, discharged patient follow-up should be strengthened. This article is protected by copyright.

Early antiviral treatment contributes to alleviate the severity and improve the prognosis of patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)	Wu, Jian; Li, Wei; Shi, Xiaowei; Chen, Zhongming; Jiang, Bin; Liu, Jun; Wang, Dawei; Liu, Chengyuan; Meng, Yiling; Cui, Leilei; Yu, Jiong; Cao, Hongcui; Li, Lanjuan	BACKGROUND: At present, the severity of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a focal point. METHODS: To assess the factors associated with severity and prognosis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, we retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed 280 cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from January 20 to February 20, 2020. RESULTS: The median age of patients in the mild group was 37.55 years old, while that in the severe group was 63.04 years old. The proportion of patients over 65 years old in the severe group was significantly higher than that of the mild group (59.04% vs. 10.15%, P < 0.05). 85.54% of severe patients had diabetes or cardiovascular diseases, which was significantly higher than that of the mild group (51.81% vs 7.11%, P = 0.025; 33.73% vs 3.05%, P = 0.042). Patients in the mild group experienced earlier initiation of antiviral treatment (1.19 Â± 0.45 vs 2.65 Â± 1.06 days in the severe group, P < 0.001). Our study showed that comorbidity, time from illness onset to antiviral, and age >=65 were three major risk factors for COVID-19 progression, while comorbidity and time from illness onset to antiviral were two major risk factors for COVID-19 recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The elderly and patients with underlying diseases are more likely to experience a severe progression of COVID-19. It is recommended that timely antiviral treatment should be initiated to slow the disease progression and improve the prognosis.	2020	NA	Journal of internal medicine	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/joim.13063	17720	#17574	Wu 2020	NA	* Comparative study, RCT; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/joim.13063	Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First People‚Äôs Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, 224005 China|Department of Hepatology, The Second People‚Äôs Hospital of Fuyang City, Fuyang, 236000 China|Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First People‚Äôs Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, 224005 China|Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Central Blood Station of Yancheng City, Yancheng, 224000 Jiangsu, China|Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Fifth People‚Äôs Hospital of Wuxi, Affiliated to Jiangnan University, Wuxi, 214005 China|Department of Infectious Disease, The Second People‚Äôs Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, 224005 China|Department of Infectious Disease, The First People‚Äôs Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, 224001 China|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Suzhou Vocational Health College, Suzhou, 215000 China|Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First People‚Äôs Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, 224005 China|Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First People‚Äôs Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, 224005 China|Department of Hepatology, The Second People‚Äôs Hospital of Fuyang City, Fuyang, 236000 China|Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First People‚Äôs Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, 224005 China|Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Central Blood Station of Yancheng City, Yancheng, 224000 Jiangsu, China|Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Fifth People‚Äôs Hospital of Wuxi, Affiliated to Jiangnan University, Wuxi, 214005 China|Department of Infectious Disease, The Second People‚Äôs Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, 224005 China|Department of Infectious Disease, The First People‚Äôs Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, 224001 China|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Suzhou Vocational Health College, Suzhou, 215000 China|Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First People‚Äôs Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, 224005 China	('China', 18)

The critical role of laboratory medicine during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other viral outbreaks	Lippi, Giuseppe; Plebani, Mario	Coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated to COVID-19 and sustained by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the latest biological hazard to assume the relevance of insidious worldwide threat. One obvious question that is now engaging the minds of many scientists and healthcare professionals is whether and eventually how laboratory medicine could efficiently contribute to counteract this and other (future) viral outbreaks. Despite there being evidence that laboratory tests are vital throughout many clinical pathways, there are at least three major areas where in vitro diagnostics can also provide essential contributions to diagnostic reasoning and managed care of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include etiological diagnosis, patient monitoring, as well as epidemiologic surveillance. Nonetheless, some structural and practical aspects may generate substantial hurdles in providing timely and efficient response to this infectious emergency, which basically include inadequate (insufficient) environment and shortage of technical and human resources for facing enhanced volume of tests on many infected patients, some of whom are with severe disease. Some proactive and reactive strategies may hence be identified to confront this serious healthcare challenge, which entail major investments on conventional laboratory resources, reinforcement of regional networks of clinical laboratories, installation of mobile laboratories, as well as being proactive in establishing laboratory emergency plans.	2020	NA	Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1515/cclm-2020-0240	10221	#10490	Lippi 2020	NA	* Narrative review	10.1515/cclm-2020-0240	Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy	('Italy', 1)

COVID-19 in post-transplantation patients- report of two cases	Huang, Jiaofeng; Lin, Heng; Wu, Yinlian; Fang, Yingying; Kumar, Rahul; Chen, Gongping; Lin, Su	Abstract Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic since March 2020. We describe here, two cases of COVID-19 infection in a post-transplant setting. First one is a 59-year old renal transplant recipient; the second is a 51-year old allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipient. Both patients were on immunosuppressant therapy and had stable graft function before COVID-19 infection. After the diagnosis of COVID-19, immunosuppressive agents were discontinued and methylprednisolone with prophylactic antibiotics were initiated, however, the lung injury progressed. The T cells were extremely low in both patients after infection. Both patients died despite the maximal mechanical ventilatory support. Therefore, the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia following transplantation is not optimistic and remains guarded. Lower T cell count may be a surrogate for poor outcome.	2020	NA	American Journal of Transplantation	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/ajt.15896	31087	#30789	Huang 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/ajt.15896	Department of Liver Research Center, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Oncology, Fuzhou Pulmonary Hospital, Fuzhou, China|Department of Liver Research Center, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Tuberculosis, the Third People's Hospital of Yichang City, Yichang, China|Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Changi General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore|Department of Respiratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Liver Research Center, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Liver Research Center, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Oncology, Fuzhou Pulmonary Hospital, Fuzhou, China|Department of Liver Research Center, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Tuberculosis, the Third People's Hospital of Yichang City, Yichang, China|Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Changi General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore|Department of Respiratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Liver Research Center, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China	('China', 12)|('Singapore', 4)
COVID-19: A Call for Physical Scientists and Engineers	Huang, Haiyue; Fan, Chunhai; Li, Min; Nie, Hua-Li; Wang, Fu-Bing; Wang, Hui; Wang, Ruilan; Xia, Jianbo; Zheng, Xin; Zuo, Xiaolei; Huang, Jiaxing	The COVID-19 pandemic is one of those global challenges that transcends territorial, political, ideological, religious, cultural, and certainly academic boundaries. Public health and healthcare workers are at the frontline, working to contain and to mitigate the spread of this disease. Although intervening biological and immunological responses against viral infection may seem far from the physical sciences and engineering that typically work with inanimate objects, there actually is much that canâ€”and shouldâ€”be done to help in this global crisis. In this Perspective, we convert the basics of infectious respiratory diseases and viruses into physical sciences and engineering intuitions, and through this exercise, we present examples of questions, hypotheses, and research needs identified based on cliniciansâ€™ experiences. We hope researchers in the physical sciences and engineering will proactively study these challenges, develop new hypotheses, define new research areas, and work with biological researchers, healthcare, and public health professionals to create user-centered solutions and to inform the general public, so that we can better address the many challenges associated with the transmission and spread of infectious respiratory diseases.	2020	NA	ACS Nano	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1021/acsnano.0c02618	44794	#42323	Huang 2020	NA	NA	10.1021/acsnano.0c02618	Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208, United States|Institute of Molecular Medicine, Shanghai Key Laboratory for Nucleic Acid Chemistry and Nanomedicine, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, China|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, China|College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University, Shanghai 201620, China|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 201600, China|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430070, China|Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China|Institute of Molecular Medicine, Shanghai Key Laboratory for Nucleic Acid Chemistry and Nanomedicine, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, China|Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208, United States|Institutional Sales	('China', 8)|('United States', 2)

The time-varying serial interval of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its gender-specific difference: A data-driven analysis using public surveillance data in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China from January 10 to February 15, 2020	Zhao, Shi; Cao, Peihua; Chong, Marc K. C.; Gao, Daozhou; Lou, Yijun; Ran, Jinjun; Wang, Kai; Wang, Weiming; Yang, Lin; He, Daihai; Wang, Maggie H.	To the Editor. An outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), started in Wuhan, China in the end of 2019 [1], has now reached 40 countries and poses huge threat to global public health and economic [2]. Given the risk of human-to-human transmission, the serial interval (SI), which refers to the time interval from symptom onset of a primary case (i.e., infector) to that of a secondary case (i.e., infectee) [3], is the other essential quantity besides the basic reproduction number to drive the spreading speed. We examine the publicly available materials and collect the records of COVID-19 transmission events in two neighboring large cities, Hong Kong [4] and Shenzhen [5], in south China from January 10 to February 15, 2020 and extract the SI data. We identify 48 transmission events including 21 in Hong Kong and 27 in Shenzhen, among which 40 events contain the gender information of the primary cases. The last onset date of the primary cases among all collected transmission events is February 2, 2020.

School Opening Delay Effect on Transmission Dynamics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Korea: Based on Mathematical Modeling and Simulation Study	Kim, Soyoung; Kim, Yae Jean; Peck, Kyong Ran; Jung, Eunok	BACKGROUND: Nonpharmaceutical intervention strategy is significantly important to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread. One of the interventions implemented by the government is a school closure. The Ministry of Education decided to postpone the school opening from March 2 to April 6 to minimize epidemic size. We aimed to quantify the school closure effect on the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: The potential effects of school opening were measured using a mathematical model considering two age groups: children (aged 19 years and younger) and adults (aged over 19). Based on susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, isolation and behavior-changed susceptible individuals are additionally considered. The transmission parameters were estimated from the laboratory confirmed data reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from February 16 to March 22. The model was extended with estimated parameters and estimated the expected number of confirmed cases as the transmission rate increased after school opening. RESULTS: Assuming the transmission rate between children group would be increasing 10 fold after the schools open, approximately additional 60 cases are expected to occur from March 2 to March 9, and approximately additional 100 children cases are expected from March 9 to March 23. After March 23, the number of expected cases for children is 28.4 for 7 days and 33.6 for 14 days. CONCLUSION: The simulation results show that the government could reduce at least 200 cases, with two announcements by the Ministry of education. After March 23, although the possibility of massive transmission in the children's age group is lower, group transmission is possible to occur.	2020	NA	Journal of Korean medical science	35	13	e143-e143	NA	10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e143	30714	#31390	Kim 2020	NA	NA	10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e143	Department of Mathematics, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.|Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

A mathematical model for simulating the phase-based transmissibility of a novel coronavirus	Yin, Tian-Mu Chen; Jia, Rui; Qiu-Peng, Wang; Ze-Yu, Zhao; Jing-An, Cui; Ling	Background As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus. Methods In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R 0) from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2. Results The value of R 0 was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58. Conclusions Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in the Republic of Korea.	2020	NA	Infectious Diseases of Poverty	9	1	8-Jan	NA	10.1186/s40249-020-00640-3	2544	#2762	Yin 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.1186/s40249-020-00640-3	Department of Mathematics, School of Science, Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Beijing, People‚Äôs Republic of China	('China', 1)
Mathematical Analysis of the Rossâ€“Macdonald Model with Quarantine	Jin, Xiulei; Jin, Shuwan; Gao, Daozhou	People infected with malaria may receive less mosquito bites when they are treated in well-equipped hospitals or follow doctorsâ€™ advice for reducing exposure to mosquitoes at home. This quarantine-like intervention measure is especially feasible in countries and areas approaching malaria elimination. Motivated by mathematical models with quarantine for directly transmitted diseases, we develop a mosquito-borne disease model where imperfect quarantine is considered to mitigate the disease transmission from infected humans to susceptible mosquitoes. The basic reproduction number $$\mathcal {R}_0$$ is computed and the model equilibria and their stabilities are analyzed when the incidence rate is standard or bilinear. In particular, the model system may undergo a subcritical (backward) bifurcation at $$\mathcal {R}_0=1$$ when standard incidence is adopted, whereas the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable as $$\mathcal {R}_0\le 1$$ and the unique endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable as $$\mathcal {R}_0>1$$ when the infection incidence is bilinear. Numerical simulations suggest that the quarantine strategy can play an important role in decreasing malaria transmission. The success of quarantine mainly relies on the reduction of bites on quarantined individuals.	2020	NA	Bulletin of Mathematical Biology	82	4	47-47	NA	10.1007/s11538-020-00723-0	30960	#30620	Jin 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s11538-020-00723-0	Department of Mathematics, Shanghai Normal University, 200234, Shanghai, China|College of Mathematical Sciences, Harbin Engineering University, 150001, Harbin, China	('China', 2)
Chest computed tomography in children with COVID-19 respiratory infection	Li, Wei; Cui, Huaqian; Li, Kunwei; Fang, Yijie; Li, Shaolin	BACKGROUND: Infection with COVID-19 is currently rare in children. OBJECTIVE: To describe chest CT findings in children with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied children at a large tertiary-care hospital in China, during the period from 28 January 2019 to 8 February 2020, who had positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19. We recorded findings at any chest CT performed in the included children, along with core clinical observations. RESULTS: We included five children from 10Â months to 6Â years of age (mean 3.4Â years). All had had at least one CT scan after admission. Three of these five had CT abnormality on the first CT scan (at 2Â days, 4Â days and 9Â days, respectively, after onset of symptoms) in the form of patchy ground-glass opacities; all normalised during treatment. CONCLUSION: Compared to reports in adults, we found similar but more modest lung abnormalities at CT in our small paediatric cohort.	2020	NA	Pediatric radiology	NA	NA	10.1007/s00247-020-04656-7	NA	10.1007/s00247-020-04656-7	7925	#7810	Li 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s00247-020-04656-7	Department of Medical Affairs, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 52 East Meihua Road, New Xiangzhou, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China	('China', 1)

Systematic review of COVID-19 in children shows milder cases and a better prognosis than adults	Ludvigsson, J. F.	AIM: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected hundreds of thousands of people. Data on symptoms and prognoses in children are rare. METHODS: A systematic literature review was carried out to identify papers on COVID-19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the Medline and EMBASE databases between 1 January and 18 March 2020. RESULTS: The search identified 45 relevant scientific papers and letters. The review showed that children have so far accounted for 1-5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases, they often have milder disease than adults and deaths have been extremely rare. Diagnostic findings have been similar to adults, with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, but fewer children seem to have developed severe pneumonia. Elevated inflammatory markers were less common in children and lymphocytopenia seemed rare. Newborn infants have developed symptomatic COVID-19, but evidence of vertical intrauterine transmission was scarce. Suggested treatment included providing oxygen, inhalations, nutritional support and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has occurred in children, but they seemed to have a milder disease course and better prognoses than adults. Deaths were extremely rare.	2020	NA	Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)	NA	NA	NA	32202343	10.1111/apa.15270	18962	#18823	Ludvigsson 2020	NA	* Systematic review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/apa.15270	Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden|Department of Paediatrics, Orebro University Hospital, Orebro, Sweden|Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA|Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden|Department of Paediatrics, Orebro University Hospital, Orebro, Sweden|Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA	('Sweden', 4)|('USA', 2)

Does SARS-CoV-2 has a longer incubation period than SARS and MERS?	Jiang, Xuan; Rayner, Simon; Luo, Min-Hua	The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) since December 2019 in Wuhan, the major transportation hub in central China, became an emergency of major international concern. While several etiological studies have begun to reveal the specific biological features of this virus, the epidemic characteristics need to be elucidated. Notably, a long incubation time was reported to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to adjustments in screening and control policies. To avoid the risk of virus spread, all potentially exposed subjects are required to be isolated for 14 days, which is the longest predicted incubation time. However, based on our analysis of a larger dataset available so far, we find there is no observable difference between the incubation time for SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), highlighting the need for larger and well-annotated datasets.	2020	NA	Journal of Medical Virology	92	5	476-478	WOS:000515227800001	10.1002/jmv.25708	10683	#10247	Jiang 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology	10.1002/jmv.25708	Department of Medical Genetics, Oslo University Hospital and University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway|University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China|Department of Medical Genetics, Oslo University Hospital and University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway|University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China	('Norway', 2)|('China', 2)

Potential preanalytical and analytical vulnerabilities in the laboratory diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)	Lippi, Giuseppe; Simundic, Ana-Maria; Plebani, Mario	A novel zoonotic coronavirus outbreak is spreading all over the world. This pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues. Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.	2020	NA	Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1515/cclm-2020-0285	8926	#8733	Lippi 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Virology, immunology	10.1515/cclm-2020-0285	Department of Medical Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital Sveti Duh, Zagreb, Croatia|Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy	('Croatia', 1)|('Italy', 1)

How we treat patients with lung cancer during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: primum non nocere	Banna, Giuseppe; Curioni-Fontecedro, Alessandra; Friedlaender, Alex; Addeo, Alfredo	New cases of the novel coronavirus, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continue to rise worldwide. A few reports have showed that mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 is higher in elderly patients and other active comorbidities including cancer. To date, no effective treatment has been identified and management for critically ill patients relies on management in intensive care units. Patients with lung cancer are at risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19. Furthermore, the use of chemotherapy might have a negative impact in patient's outcome. Therefore, the risk/benefit ratio of systemic anticancer treatment (SACT) has to be considered. For each patient, several factors including age and comorbidities, as well as the number of hospital visits for treatment, can influence this risk. Each hospital around the world has issued some internal policy guidelines for oncologists, aiming to limit risks during this difficult time. We hereby propose a tool to support oncologists and physicians in treatment decision for patients with lung cancer. There are several variables to consider, including the extent of the epidemic, the local healthcare structure capacity, the risk of infection to the individual, the status of cancer, patients' comorbidities, age and details of the treatment. Given this heterogeneity, we have based our suggestions bearing in mind some general factors There is not easy, universal solution to oncological care during this crisis and, to complicate matters, the duration of this pandemic is hard to predict. It is important to weigh the impact of each of our decisions in these trying times rather than rely on routine automatisms.	2020	NA	ESMO Open	NA	NA	NA	32245904	10.1136/esmoopen-2020-000765	31306	#34211	Banna 2020	NA	NA	10.1136/esmoopen-2020-000765	Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology|University Hospital Zurich|Department of Oncology|University Hospital of Geneva	NA

Covid-19: automatic detection from X-ray images utilizing transfer learning with convolutional neural networks	Apostolopoulos, Ioannis D.; Mpesiana, Tzani A.	In this study, a dataset of X-ray images from patients with common bacterial pneumonia, confirmed Covid-19 disease, and normal incidents, was utilized for the automatic detection of the CoronavirusÂ disease. The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures proposed overÂ the recent years for medical image classification. Specifically, the procedure called Transfer Learning was adopted. With transfer learning, the detection of various abnormalities in small medical image datasets is an achievable target, often yielding remarkable results. The datasets utilized in this experiment are two. Firstly, a collection of 1427 X-ray images including 224 images with confirmed Covid-19 disease, 700 images with confirmed common bacterial pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions. Secondly, a dataset including 224 images with confirmed Covid-19 disease, 714 images with confirmed bacterial and viral pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions. The data was collected from the available X-ray images on public medical repositories. The results suggest that Deep LearningÂ with X-rayÂ imaging may extract significant biomarkers related to the Covid-19 disease, while the best accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity obtained is 96.78%, 98.66%, and 96.46% respectively. Since by now, all diagnostic tests show failure rates such as to raise concerns, the probability of incorporating X-rays into the diagnosis of the disease could be assessed by the medical community, based on the findings, while more research to evaluate the X-ray approach from different aspects may be conducted.	2020	NA	Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine	NA	NA	6-Jan	NA	10.1007/s13246-020-00865-4	30954	#31513	Apostolopoulos 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s13246-020-00865-4	Department of Medical Physics, School of Medicine, University of Patras, 26504, Patras, Greece	('Greece', 1)
Gastrointestinal and Liver Manifestations in Patients with COVID-19	Lee, I. Cheng; Huo, Teh-Ia; Huang, Yi-Hsiang	As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread over the world, the World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of COVID-19 an international public health emergency. Besides typical respiratory symptoms and signs of COVID-19, digestive symptoms and liver injury have been frequently reported during the course of the disease. In this review, we summarized the recent studies reporting of gastrointestinal and liver manifestations during the course of COVID-19. Digestive symptoms, including anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19, and in some cases digestive symptoms may occur in the absence of any respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in the stool of infected patients, implicating the possibility of fecal-oral transmission. Attention should also be paid to monitor liver function during the course of COVID-19, especially in patients with higher disease severity.	2020	NA	J Chin Med Assoc	NA	NA	NA	32243269	10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000319	31417	#33813	Lee 2020	NA	NA	10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000319	Department of Medical Research, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC|Institute of Pharmacology, National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC|Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC	NA

Coronavirus: Update Related to the Current Outbreak of COVID-19	Gabutti, Giovanni; dâ€™Anchera, Erica; Sandri, Federica; Savio, Marta; Stefanati, Armando	In December 2019, some cases of viral pneumonia were epidemiologically related to a new coronavirus in the province of Hubei, China. Subsequently, there has been an increase in infections attributable to this virus throughout China and worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2Â (SARS-CoV-2). This appears to be a virus from Rhinolophus bats, but the intermediate host has not yet been identified. The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known; it appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates. The interhuman transmission of coronaviruses mainly occurs through saliva droplets and direct and indirect contact via surfaces. As of March 10, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was 113,702. Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome. The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities. To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection implies strategies that limit the spread of the virus. WHO and other international and national bodies have developed continuously updated strategic objectives and provisions to contain the spread of the virus and infection.	2020	NA	Infectious Diseases and Therapy	NA	NA	13-Jan	NA	10.1007/s40121-020-00295-5	45219	#42106	Gabutti 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s40121-020-00295-5	Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy	('Italy', 1)
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Dalbavancin Treatment in Severe Necrotizing Fasciitis in 3 Critically Ill Patients: A Grand Round	Corona, Alberto; Agarossi, Andrea; Veronese, Alice; Cattaneo, Dario; D'Avolio, Antonio	Background: Dalbavancin, albeit indicated for the treatment of skin structure infections, is used for a much wider range of infections. This drug is characterized by a long half-life (more than 200 hours), a favorable safety profile, and an activity against a wide array of gram-positive organisms, including several strains of Staphylococci and Enterococci. Methods: In this study, we presented 3 cases of critically ill patients treated with dalbavancin. All patients were therapeutically monitored for plasma dalbavancin concentrations; ultrafiltrate dalbavancin concentrations were assessed in a patient undergoing continuous renal-replacement therapy. Dalbavancin concentrations were measured using a validated liquid chromatographic method coupled with mass spectrometry. Results: All 3 severely ill patients experiencing necrotizing fasciitis were successfully treated during the acute phase with dalbavancin. Dalbavancin clearance in patient 3 (0.334 L/h) was considerably increased compared with values measured in the other 2 patients (0.054 and 0.075 L/h) and with data reported in the literature (0.04â€“0.06 L/h). Conclusions: Our case reports presented preliminary evidence that dalbavancin can be considered a therapeutic option for necrotizing fasciitis in intensive care unit patients. The role of hypoalbuminemia during dalbavancin exposure merits further investigation.	2020	NA	Therapeutic Drug Monitoring	42	2	165-168	00007691-202004000-00002	10.1097/ftd.0000000000000729	12191	#11505	Corona 2020	NA	* Comparative study, RCT; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1097/ftd.0000000000000729	Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin‚ÄîASL ‚ÄúCitt√† di Torino‚Äù Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetics, Amedeo di Savoia Hospital, Turin, Italy.

Bat-borne viruses in Africa: a critical review	Markotter, W.; Coertse, J.; De Vries, L.; Geldenhuys, M.; Mortlock, M.	Abstract In Africa, bat-borne zoonoses emerged in the past few decades resulting in large outbreaks or just sporadic spillovers. In addition, hundreds of more viruses are described without any information on zoonotic potential. We discuss important characteristics of bats including bat biology, evolution, distribution and ecology that not only make them unique among most mammals but also contribute to their potential as viral reservoirs. The detection of a virus in bats does not imply that spillover will occur and several biological, ecological and anthropogenic factors play a role in such an event. We summarize and critically analyse the current knowledge on African bats as reservoirs for corona-, filo-, paramyxo- and lyssaviruses. We highlight that important information on epidemiology, bat biology and ecology is often not available to make informed decisions on zoonotic spillover potential. Even if knowledge gaps exist, it is still important to recognize the role of bats in zoonotic disease outbreaks and implement mitigation strategies to prevent exposure to infectious agents including working safely with bats. Equally important is the crucial role of bats in various ecosystem services. This necessitates a multidisciplinary One Health approach to close knowledge gaps and ensure the development of responsible mitigation strategies to not only minimize risk of infection but also ensure conservation of the species.

Medicinal chemistry strategies toward host targeting antiviral agents	Ji, Xingyue; Li, Zhuorong	Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) represent a class of drugs targeting viral proteins and have been demonstrated to be very successful in combating viral infections in clinic. However, DAAs suffer from several inherent limitations, including narrow-spectrum antiviral profiles and liability to drug resistance, and hence there are still unmet needs in the treatment of viral infections. In comparison, host targeting antivirals (HTAs) target host factors for antiviral treatment. Since host proteins are probably broadly required for various viral infections, HTAs are not only perceived, but also demonstrated to exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activities. In addition, host proteins are not under the genetic control of viral genome, and hence HTAs possess much higher genetic barrier to drug resistance as compared with DAAs. In recent years, much progress has been made to the development of HTAs with the approval of chemokine receptor type 5 antagonist maraviroc for human immunodeficiency virus treatment and more in the pipeline for other viral infections. In this review, we summarize various host proteins as antiviral targets from a medicinal chemistry prospective. Challenges and issues associated with HTAs are also discussed.

Use of Rapid Online Surveys to Assess People's Perceptions During Infectious Disease Outbreaks: A Cross-sectional Survey on COVID-19	Geldsetzer, Pascal	BACKGROUND: Given the extensive time needed to conduct a nationally representative household survey and the commonly low response rate of phone surveys, rapid online surveys may be a promising method to assess and track knowledge and perceptions among the general public during fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the general public in the United States and the United Kingdom. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to 3000 adults residing in the United States and 3000 adults residing in the United Kingdom who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research. Prolific Academic established strata by age (18-27, 28-37, 38-47, 48-57, or â‰¥58 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (white, black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, mixed, or "other"), as well as all permutations of these strata. The number of participants who could enroll in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population. Enrollment into the survey within each stratum was on a first-come, first-served basis. Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2986 and 2988 adults residing in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively, completed the questionnaire. Of those, 64.4% (1924/2986) of US participants and 51.5% (1540/2988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree, 67.5% (2015/2986) of US participants had a total household income between US $20,000 and US $99,999, and 74.4% (2223/2988) of UK participants had a total household income between Â£15,000 and Â£74,999. US and UK participants' median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 5.0% (IQR 2.0%-15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR 2.0%-10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of COVID-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI 36.1%-39.6%) of US participants and 29.7% (95% CI 28.1%-31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was "highly effective" in protecting them from acquiring COVID-19, and 25.6% (95% CI 24.1%-27.2%) of US participants and 29.6% (95% CI 28.0%-31.3%) of UK participants thought it was prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8%, 95% CI 52.1%-55.6%) of US participants and 39.1% (95% CI 37.4%-40.9%) of UK participants thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of participants by total household income and education followed approximately that of the US and UK general population. The findings from this online survey could guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media. More broadly, rapid online surveys could be an important tool in tracking the public's knowledge and misperceptions during rapidly moving infectious disease outbreaks.	2020	NA	Journal of medical Internet research	22	4	e18790-e18790	NA	10.2196/18790	30705	#31395	Geldsetzer 2020	NA	NA	10.2196/18790	Department of Medicine	NA

Lung ultrasound (LU) has rapidly become a tool for assessment of patients stricken by the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Over the past two and a half months (January, February and first half of March 2020) we have used this modality for identification of lung involvement along with pulmonary severity in patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 infection. Use of LU has helped us in clinical decision making and reduced the use of both chest x-rays and computed tomography (CT).	2020	NA	Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)

Diabetes and COVID-19	Bloomgarden, Zachary T.	We acknowledge the frontline medical staff working day and night in China to rescue critical cases and protect the public health. We know that these great efforts are now and will be in the future crucial in overcoming COVIDâ€19. Providing care to people with diabetes is an important part of the effort. The Journal of Diabetes was started more than a decade ago in a spirit of collaboration between East and West addressing the epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, management, complications, and prevention of diabetes. The journal is issuing a call for submission of commentaries, original articles, and case reports regarding issues with COVIDâ€19 in patients with diabetes, as well as descriptions of basic aspects of the interrelationships between diabetes and the novel CoV. We hope in this way to support the thousands of Chinese medical workers involving themselves in the care of patients with COVIDâ€19, and we look forward to these efforts helping our goal of eradication of the disease	2020	NA	Journal of Diabetes	12	4	347-348	NA	10.1111/1753-0407.13027	7870	#7501	Bloomgarden 2020	NA	* Narrative review; * Opinion piece	10.1111/1753-0407.13027	Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Bone Disease, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York|Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Bone Disease, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York	NA

Surviving Sepsis Campaign: guidelines on the management of critically ill adults with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)	Alhazzani, Waleed; MÃ¸ller, Morten Hylander; Arabi, Yaseen M.; Loeb, Mark; Gong, Michelle Ng; Fan, Eddy; Oczkowski, Simon; Levy, Mitchell M.; Derde, Lennie; Dzierba, Amy; Du, Bin; Aboodi, Michael; Wunsch, Hannah; Cecconi, Maurizio; Koh, Younsuck; Chertow, Daniel S.; Maitland, Kathryn; Alshamsi, Fayez; Belley-Cote, Emilie; Greco, Massimiliano; Laundy, Matthew; Morgan, Jill S.; Kesecioglu, Jozef; McGeer, Allison; Mermel, Leonard; Mammen, Manoj J.; Alexander, Paul E.; Arrington, Amy; Centofanti, John E.; Citerio, Giuseppe; Baw, Bandar; Memish, Ziad A.; Hammond, Naomi; Hayden, Frederick G.; Evans, Laura; Rhodes, Andrew	The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world. Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed. We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for 6 questions. The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19. When available, we will provide new recommendations in further releases of these guidelines.	2020	NA	Intensive Care Medicine	NA	NA	Jan-34	NA	10.1007/s00134-020-06022-5	17899	#17690	Alhazzani 2020	NA	* Normative guidance; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s00134-020-06022-5	Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada|Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada|Department of Intensive Care, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, 4131, Copenhagen, Denmark|Department of Intensive Care Medicine, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands|Department of Pharmacy, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada|Department of Anesthesia and Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada|Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Rozzano, Milan, Italy|Department of Biomedical Science, Humanitas University, Pieve Emanuele, Milan, Italy|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea|Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, PO Box 17666, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates|Department of Medicine, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, USA|Department of Anesthesia, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada|Department of Medicine and Surgery, Milano-Bicocca University, Milan, Italy|Department of Emergency Medicine, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia	('Canada', 5)|('Italy', 3)|('USA', 2)|('United Arab Emirates', 2)|('Denmark', 1)|('Netherlands', 1)|('Saudi Arabia', 1)
COVID-19: An Update on the Epidemiological, Clinical, Preventive and Therapeutic Evidence and Guidelines of Integrative Chinese-Western Medicine for the Management of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19): a guide for UK GPs	Chan, K. W.; Wong, V. T.; Tang, S. C. W.; Razai, M. S.; Doerholt, K.; Ladhani, S.; Oakeshott, P.	As of 22 February 2020, more than 77662 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have been documented globally with over 2360 deaths. Common presentations of confirmed cases include fever, fatigue, dry cough, upper airway congestion, sputum production, shortness of breath, myalgia/arthralgia with lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. The reported severe/critical case ratio is approximately 7-10% and median time to intensive care admission is 9.5-10.5 days with mortality of around 1-2% varied geographically. Similar to outbreaks of other newly identified virus, there is no proven regimen from conventional medicine and most reports managed the patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, beta-interferon, glucocorticoid and supportive treatment with remdesivir undergoing clinical trial. In China, Chinese medicine is proposed as a treatment option by national and provincial guidelines with substantial utilization. We reviewed the latest national and provincial clinical guidelines, retrospective cohort studies, and case series regarding the treatment of COVID-19 by add-on Chinese medicine. We have also reviewed the clinical evidence generated from SARS and H1N1 management with hypothesized mechanisms and latest in silico findings to identify candidate Chinese medicines for the consideration of possible trials and management.

A Practical Approach to the Management of Cancer Patients During the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: An International Collaborative Group	Al-Shamsi, Humaid O.; Alhazzani, Waleed; Alhuraiji, Ahmad; Coomes, Eric A.; Chemaly, Roy F.; Almuhanna, Meshari; Wolff, Robert; Nuhad, Ibrahim K.; Chua, Melvin L. K.; Hotte, Sebastien J.; Meyers, Brandon M.; Elfiki, Tarek; Curigliano, Giuseppe; Eng, Cathy; Grothey, Axel; Xie, Conghua	Abstract The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread globally since being identified as a public health emergency of major international concern and has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, known as COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. The newly identified zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Many cancer patients frequently visit the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance. They may be immunocompromised due to the underlying malignancy or anticancer therapy and are at higher risk of developing infections. Several factors increase the risk of infection, and cancer patients commonly have multiple risk factors. Cancer patients appear to have an estimated twofold increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. With the WHO declaring the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, there is an urgent need to address the impact of such a pandemic on cancer patients. This include changes to resource allocation, clinical care, and the consent process during a pandemic. Currently and due to limited data, there are no international guidelines to address the management of cancer patients in any infectious pandemic. In this review, the potential challenges associated with managing cancer patients during the COVID-19 infection pandemic will be addressed, with suggestions of some practical approaches.

Emerging infectious diseases and outbreaks: implications for womenâ€™s reproductive health and rights in resource-poor settings	Chattu, Vijay Kumar; Yaya, Sanni	This century is witnessing dramatic changes in the health needs of the worldâ€™s populations. The double burden of infectious and chronic diseases constitutes major causes of morbidity and mortality. Over the last two decades, there has been a rise in infectious diseases, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS), the H1N1 pandemic influenza, the Ebolavirus and the Covid-19 virus. These diseases have rapidly spread across the world and have reminded us of the unprecedented connectivity that defines our modern civilization. Though some countries have made substantial progress toward improving global surveillance for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), the vast majority of Low-and Middle-income Countries (LMICs) with fragile health systems and various system-related bottlenecks remain vulnerable to outbreaks and, as such, experience dramatic social and economic consequences when they are reported. Lessons learned from past outbreaks suggest that gender inequalities are common across a range of health issues relating to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), with women being particularly disadvantaged, partially due to the burden placed on them. Though these countries are striving to improve their health systems and be more inclusive to this vulnerable group, the national/ global outbreaks have burdened the overall system and thus paralyzed normal services dedicated to the delivery of Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services. In this paper, we discuss the global commitments to SRH, the impact of the EIDs on the LMICs, the failure in the delivery of SRH services, and the strategies for successful implementation of recovery plans that must address the specific and differentiated needs of women and girls in resource-poor settings.	2020	NA	Reproductive Health	17	1	43-43	NA	10.1186/s12978-020-0899-y	26037	#23942	Chattu 2020	NA	NA	10.1186/s12978-020-0899-y	Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada	('Canada', 1)
Current Status of Cell-Based Therapies for Respiratory Virus Infections: Applicability to COVID-19	Khoury, Maroun; Cuenca, Jimena; Cruz, Fernanda F.; Figueroa, Fernando E.; Rocco, Patricia R. M.; Weiss, Daniel J.	Severe respiratory consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have prompted urgent need for novel therapies. Cell-based approaches, primarily using mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSCs), have demonstrated safety and possible efficacy in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), although not as yet well studied in respiratory virus-induced ARDS. Limited pre-clinical data suggest that systemic MSC administration can significantly reduce respiratory virus (Influenza strains H5N1 and H9N2)-induced lung injury, however, there are no available data in models of coronavirus respiratory infection.There are a rapidly increasing number of clinical investigations of cell-based therapy approaches for COVID-19. These utilise a range of different cell sources, doses, dosing strategies, and targeted patient populations. To provide a rationale strategy to maximise potential therapeutic use, it is critically important to understand the relevant pre-clinical studies and postulated mechanisms of MSC actions in respiratory virus-induced lung injuries. These are presented along with consideration of current clinical investigations.	2020	NA	The European respiratory journal	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1183/13993003.00858-2020	45145	#42121	Khoury 2020	NA	NA	10.1183/13993003.00858-2020	Department of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA	('USA', 1)
Hiding in Plain Sight: an Approach to Treating Patients with Severe COVID-19 Infection	Fedson, D. S.; Opal, S. M.; Rordam, O. M.	Patients with COVID-19 infection are at risk of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) and death. The tissue receptor for COVID-19 is ACE2, and higher levels of ACE2 can protect against ARDS. Angiotensin receptor blockers and statins upregulate ACE2. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether this drug combination might be used to treat patients with severe COVID-19 infection.	2020	NA	mBio	11	2	NA	32198275	10.1128/mBio.00398-20	12278	#11461	Fedson 2020	NA	* Normative guidance; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1128/mBio.00398-20	Department of Medicine, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA	('USA', 1)
Soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2: a potential approach for coronavirus infection therapy?	Batlle, Daniel; Wysocki, Jan; Satchell, Karla	A new coronavirus, referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for the recent outbreak of severe respiratory disease. This outbreak first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread to other regions of China and to 25 other countries as of January, 2020. It has been known since the 2003 SARS epidemic that the receptor critical for SARS-CoV entry into host cells is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S1 domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV attaches the virus to its cellular receptor ACE2 on the host cells. We thought that it is timely to explain the connection between the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and the rationale for soluble ACE2 as a potential therapy.	2020	NA	Clinical science (London, England : 1979)	134	5	543-545	NA	10.1042/CS20200163	8775	#8347	Batlle 2020	NA	Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1042/CS20200163	Department of Medicine/ Division of Nephrology/Hypertension, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.|Department of Medicine/ Division of Nephrology/Hypertension, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.|Department Microbiology-Immunology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.

Utilization of a mobile platform for the dissemination of validated institutional measurements during CoVid-19 Outbreak: A practical example in the Children's Hospital	Zamberg, Ido; Manzano, Sergio; Posfay-Barbe, Klara; Windisch, Olivier; Agoritsas, Thomas; Schiffer, Eduardo	BACKGROUND: As part of response plans for current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, authorities are drafting and implementing containment measures across jurisdictions worldwide in the effort to slow transmission and infection rate. A solid communication strategy is needed to increase the reach of valid information to health professionals, reduce misinformation, and efficiently implement recommended measures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to describe the utilization of a dedicated mHealth platform to disseminate up-to-date and validated information about the SARS-CoV-2 to all medical staff of the Children's Hospital at the University Hospitals of Geneva. METHODS: Three documents containing institutional information concerning screening, local containment procedures as well as FAQ for parents were made available to the staff through a mobile application developed in the University of Geneva, Switzerland. Using a third-party statistics tool, we anonymously monitored user activity as well as content utilization patterns since the diagnostic of the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland on February 25, 2020. RESULTS: During the period of February 25 to March 13, 2020 (18 days) information documents on SARS-CoV-2 were viewed 859 times which amounted for 35.6% of total content views. User activity increased significantly with 50.8 (SD = 14.4) vs 26.4 (SD = 9.8) users per day comparing to previous weeks (p < 0.001). In addition, sessions number per day more than doubled during mentioned period (p < 0.001). In a survey medical staff found the information easy to find within the application. On a 10 point Likert-scale the ability of the application to reassure staff in clinical practice was rated 7.6 (SD = 2.1), time-saving ability was rated 8.5/10 (SD = 2.1) and the need to look for information from other sources was rated with a score of 5.9/10 (SD = 3.3). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a mHealth solution to disseminate novel coronavirus related information seemed to be an effective and timesaving communication channel within our institution during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Medical staff felt reassured and informed in daily practice. More research should be done concerning the clinical impact and outcomes of the integration of mHealth solutions as a communication channel of validated information within health institutions.	2020	NA	JMIR Public Health Surveill	NA	NA	NA	32250958	10.2196/18668	41581	#40235	Zamberg 2020	NA	NA	10.2196/18668	Department of Medicine|University Hospitals of Geneva	NA

SARS-CoV-2: A Storm is Raging	Pedersen, Savannah F.; Ho, Ya-Chi	The pandemic coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is rapidly spreading across the globe. In this issue of the JCI, Chen and colleagues compared the clinical and immunologic characteristics between moderate versus severe COVID-19. The authors found that respiratory distress on admission is associated with unfavorable outcomes. Increased cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-10 and TNFÎ±), lymphopenia (in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells), and decreased IFNÎ³ expression in CD4+ T cells are associated with severe COVID-19. Overall, this study characterized the cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 and provides insights into immune therapeutics and vaccine design.	2020	NA	The Journal of clinical investigation	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1172/JCI137647	17768	#17603	Pedersen 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Epidemiology	10.1172/JCI137647	Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.|Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.

Impact of COVID-19 and Future Emerging Viruses on Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and Other Cellular Therapies	Broxmeyer, Hal E.; Parker, Graham C.	COVID-19 where Co stand for corona, VI stands for virus, and D denotes disease and was in the recent past referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV, has impacted numerous lives and businesses, and has led to a surreal emergency state within world communities. COVID-19 and the future emergence of dangerous viruses will have strong, and as yet possibly unanticipated consequences and impact on the present and future use of cellular therapies. In this commentary we offer a dispassionate assessment of where we believe COVID-19, as well as future emerging viruses might compromise successful cell transplantation.	2020	NA	Stem cells and development	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1089/scd.2020.0064	26537	#26795	Broxmeyer 2020	NA	NA	10.1089/scd.2020.0064	Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.|Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan.

Distinct Roles for Sialoside and Protein Receptors in Coronavirus Infection	Qing, Enya; Hantak, Michael; Perlman, Stanley; Gallagher, Tom	Coronaviruses (CoVs) are common human and animal pathogens that can transmit zoonotically and cause severe respiratory disease syndromes. CoV infection requires spike proteins, which bind viruses to host cell receptors and catalyze virus-cell membrane fusion. Several CoV strains have spike proteins with two receptor-binding domains, an S1A that engages host sialic acids and an S1B that recognizes host transmembrane proteins. As this bivalent binding may enable broad zoonotic CoV infection, we aimed to identify roles for each receptor in distinct infection stages. Focusing on two betacoronaviruses, murine JHM-CoV and human Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we found that virus particle binding to cells was mediated by sialic acids; however, the transmembrane protein receptors were required for a subsequent virus infection. These results favored a two-step process in which viruses first adhere to sialic acids and then require subsequent engagement with protein receptors during infectious cell entry. However, sialic acids sufficiently facilitated the later stages of virus spread through cell-cell membrane fusion, without requiring protein receptors. This virus spread in the absence of the prototype protein receptors was increased by adaptive S1A mutations. Overall, these findings reveal roles for sialic acids in virus-cell binding, viral spike protein-directed cell-cell fusion, and resultant spread of CoV infections.IMPORTANCE CoVs can transmit from animals to humans to cause serious disease. This zoonotic transmission uses spike proteins, which bind CoVs to cells with two receptor-binding domains. Here, we identified the roles for the two binding processes in the CoV infection process. Binding to sialic acids promoted infection and also supported the intercellular expansion of CoV infections through syncytial development. Adaptive mutations in the sialic acid-binding spike domains increased the intercellular expansion process. These findings raise the possibility that the lectin-like properties of many CoVs contribute to facile zoonotic transmission and intercellular spread within infected organisms.	2020	NA	mBio	11	1	e02764-19	NA	10.1128/mBio.02764-19	1467	#2427	Qing 2020	NA	Virology, immunology	10.1128/mBio.02764-19	Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois, USA|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois, USA|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois, USA	('USA', 4)

Coronavirus endoribonuclease targets viral polyuridine sequences to evade activating host sensors	Hackbart, M.; Deng, X.; Baker, S. C.	Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense RNA viruses that can emerge from endemic reservoirs and infect zoonotically, causing significant morbidity and mortality. CoVs encode an endoribonuclease designated EndoU that facilitates evasion of host pattern recognition receptor MDA5, but the target of EndoU activity was not known. Here, we report that EndoU cleaves the 5'-polyuridines from negative-sense viral RNA, termed PUN RNA, which is the product of polyA-templated RNA synthesis. Using a virus containing an EndoU catalytic-inactive mutation, we detected a higher abundance of PUN RNA in the cytoplasm compared to wild-type-infected cells. Furthermore, we found that transfecting PUN RNA into cells stimulates a robust, MDA5-dependent interferon response, and that removal of the polyuridine extension on the RNA dampens the response. Overall, the results of this study reveal the PUN RNA to be a CoV MDA5-dependent pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). We also establish a mechanism for EndoU activity to cleave and limit the accumulation of this PAMP. Since EndoU activity is highly conserved in all CoVs, inhibiting this activity may serve as an approach for therapeutic interventions against existing and emerging CoV infections.	2020	NA	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1073/pnas.1921485117	12284	#11430	Hackbart 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1073/pnas.1921485117	Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stritch School of Medicine, |Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stritch School of Medicine, |Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stritch School of Medicine, 	NA

W.; Ho, Pak-Leung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung	Background:To describe the infection control preparedness for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 [previously known as 2019-novel coronavirus] in the first 42 days after announcement of a cluster of pneumonia in China, on 31 December 2019 (day 1) in Hong Kong.Methods:A bundle approach of active and enhanced laboratory surveillance, early airborne infection isolation, rapid molecular diagnostic testing, and contact tracing for healthcare workers (HCWs) with unprotected exposure in the hospitals was implemented. Epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases, environmental and air samples were collected and analyzed.Results:From day 1 to day 42, forty-two (3.3%) of 1275 patients fulfilling active (n=29) and enhanced laboratory surveillance (n=13) confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. The number of locally acquired case significantly increased from 1 (7.7%) of 13 [day 22 to day 32] to 27 (93.1%) of 29 confirmed case [day 33 to day 42] (p&lt;0.001). Twenty-eight patients (66.6%) came from 8 family clusters. Eleven (2.7%) of 413 HCWs caring these confirmed cases were found to have unprotected exposure requiring quarantine for 14 days. None of them was infected and nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not observed. Environmental surveillance performed in a patient with viral load of 3.3x106 copies/ml (pooled nasopharyngeal/ throat swab) and 5.9x106 copies/ml (saliva) respectively. SARS-CoV-2 revealed in 1 (7.7%) of 13 environmental samples, but not in 8 air samples collected at a distance of 10 cm from patient's chin with or without wearing a surgical mask.Conclusion:Appropriate hospital infection control measures could prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Antigen Capture Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Detecting Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in Humans	Fung, J.; Lau, S. K. P.; Woo, P. C. Y.	The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is the second novel zoonotic disease infecting humans caused by coronavirus (CoV) in this century. To date, more than 2200 laboratory-confirmed human cases have been identified in 27 countries, and more than 800 MERS-CoV associated deaths have been reported since its outbreak in 2012. Rapid laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV is the key to successful containment and prevention of the spread of infection. Though the gold standard for diagnosing MERS-CoV infection in humans is still nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) of the up-E region, an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) could also be of use for early diagnosis in less developed locations. In the present method, a step-by-step guide to perform a MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) capture ELISA using two NP-specific monoclonal antibodies is provided for readers to develop their in-house workflow or diagnostic kit for clinical use and for mass-screening project of animals (e.g., dromedaries and bats) to better understand the spread and evolution of the virus.	2020	NA	Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)	2099	NA	89-97	31883089	10.1007/978-1-0716-0211-9_7	42	#36	Fung 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Virology, immunology	10.1007/978-1-0716-0211-9_7	Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine	NA

Crossâ€species transmission of the newly identified coronavirus 2019â€nCoV	Ji, Wei; Wang, Wei; Zhao, Xiaofang; Zai, Junjie; Li, Xingguang	The current outbreak of viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel coronavirus designated 2019â€nCoV by the World Health Organization, as determined by sequencing the viral RNA genome. Many initial patients were exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold. To investigate possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on the 2019â€nCoV sequence. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019â€nCoV may appear to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an originâ€unknown coronavirus. The recombination may occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes a cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that 2019â€nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and most similar codon usage bias with snake. Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination may occur and contribute to the 2019â€nCoV crossâ€species transmission.	2020	NA	Journal of Medical Virology	92	4	433-440	NA	https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25682	1174	#2245	Ji 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Other related diseases and viruses; Reservoir; Virology, immunology	10.1002/jmv.25682	Department of Microbiology, Peking University Health Science Center School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, China|Department of Spleen and Stomach Diseases, The First affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, China|Department of Science and Technology, Ruikang Hospital Affiliated to Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, China|Department of Microbiology, Peking University Health Science Center School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, China|Department of Spleen and Stomach Diseases, The First affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, China|Department of Science and Technology, Ruikang Hospital Affiliated to Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, China	('China', 6)|('uika', 2)
Homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein of the newly identified coronavirus may boost cross-species transmission from snake to human	Ji, W.; Wang, W.; Zhao, X.; Zai, J.; Li, X.	The current outbreak of viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel coronavirus designated 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization, as determined by sequencing the viral RNA genome. Many patients were potentially exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold. To determine the possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on existing sequences of the newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV appears to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. The recombination occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV based on its RSCU bias resembling snake compared to other animals. Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein may contribute to cross-species transmission from snake to humans.

Structural Variations in Human ACE2 may Influence its Binding with SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein	Hussain, Mushtaq; Jabeen, Nusrat; Raza, Fozia; Shabbir, Sanya; Baig, Ayesha Ashraf; Amanullah, Anusha; Aziz, Basma	The recent pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is unarguably the most fearsome compared to the earlier outbreaks caused by other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Human ACE2 is now established as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Where variations in the viral spike protein in turn lead to the cross species transmission of the virus, genetic variations in the host receptor ACE2, may also contribute to the susceptibility and/or resistance against the viral infection. This study aims to explore the binding of the proteins encoded by different human ACE2 allelic variants with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Briefly, coding variants of ACE2 corresponding to the reported binding sites for its attachment with coronavirus spike protein were selected and molecular models of these variants were constructed by homology modelling. The models were then superimposed over the native ACE2 and ACE2-spike protein complex, to observe structural changes in the ACE2 variants and their intermolecular interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein respectively. Despite strong overall structural similarities, spatial orientation of the key interacting residues varies in the ACE2 variants compared to the wild type molecule. Most ACE2 variants showed similar binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as observed in the complex structure of wild type ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. However, ACE2 alleles, rs73635825 (S19P) and rs143936283 (E329G) showed noticeable variations in their intermolecular interactions with the viral spike protein. In summary, our data provide structural basis of potential resistance against SARS-CoV-2 infection driven by ACE2 allelic variants. This article is protected by copyright.

Evolutionary history, potential intermediate animal host, and cross-species analyses of SARS-CoV-2	Li, Xingguang; Zai, Junjie; Zhao, Qiang; Nie, Qing; Li, Yi; Foley, Brian T.; Chaillon, Antoine	Abstract To investigate the evolutionary history of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in China, a total of 70 genomes of virus strains from China and elsewhere with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 3 February 2020 were analyzed. To explore the potential intermediate animal host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we re-analyzed virome datasets from pangolins and representative SARS-related coronaviruses isolates from bats, with particular attention paid to the spike glycoprotein gene. We performed phylogenetic, split network, transmission network, likelihood-mapping, and comparative analyses of the genomes. Based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method, we estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, which ranged from 22?24 November 2019 and 1.19?1.31 ? 10-3 substitutions per site per year, respectively. Our results also revealed that the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus was more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than the coronavirus obtained from the two pangolin samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378). We also identified a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion in the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by cellular proteases, and thus could impact host range and transmissibility. Interestingly, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not have the RRAR motif. Therefore, we concluded that the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the recent outbreak of COVID-19, did not come directly from pangolins. This article is protected by copyright.

Is Pakistan prepared for the COVID-19 epidemic? A questionnaire-based survey	Khan, Samea; Khan, Mahjabeen; Maqsood, Khizra; Hussain, Tanveer; Noor ul, Huda; Zeeshan, Muhammad	Abstract COVID-19 is a pandemic that began in China in December 2019. World health organization (WHO) has expressed fears that Pakistan might emerge as the next epicenter of this pandemic. We hypothesize that at present the Pakistani masses are not prepared to face any threat of a looming epidemic. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the basic knowledge of educational and health care workers (HCW's) regarding COVID-19, its control, and prevention. Knowledge about origin, symptoms, and spread of viral infection was assessed. In this cross-sectional survey, a self-designed questionnaire was distributed among 302 HCWs including physicians (10.9%), nurses (1.32%), lab staff (1.65%) and academic individuals including faculty and students (86.42%) of different organizations. Results were analyzed using the chi-square test. Obtained results validate our null hypothesis that Pakistani masses are not well aware of the COVID-19 and strategies for the prevention and control of infection. The Study concluded that individuals belonging to the front-line workers and high literacy groups are not prepared for the alarming situation in the country.

Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation	Wrapp, Daniel; Wang, Nianshuang; Corbett, Kizzmekia S.; Goldsmith, Jory A.; Hsieh, Ching-Lin; Abiona, Olubukola; Graham, Barney S.; McLellan, Jason S.	The outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus (2019-nCoV) represents a pandemic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure (MCM) development, we determined a 3.5 Ã…-resolution cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable rapid development and evaluation of MCMs to address the ongoing public health crisis.	2020	NA	Science	NA	NA	eabb2507	32075877	10.1126/science.abb2507	165	#1461	Wrapp 2020	NA	Virology, immunology	10.1126/science.abb2507	Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA.|Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA.|Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA.|Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA.|Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA.|Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA.

Network-based drug repurposing for novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2	Zhou, Y.; Hou, Y.; Shen, J.; Huang, Y.; Martin, W.; Cheng, F.	Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as SARS-CoV-2), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV-host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the "Complementary Exposure" pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.	2020	NA	Cell discovery	6	NA	14	32194980	10.1038/s41421-020-0153-3	11680	#11098	Zhou 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1038/s41421-020-0153-3	Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA	('USA', 1)

Serious games for serious crises: reflections from an infectious disease outbreak matrix game	Smith, Julia; Sears, Nathan; Taylor, Ben; Johnson, Madeline	While there is widespread recognition of global health failures when it comes to infectious disease outbreaks, there is little discussion on how policy-makers and global health organizations can learn to better prepare and respond. Serious games provide an underutilized tool to promote learning and innovation around global health crises. In order to explore the potential of Serious Games as a policy learning tool, Global Affairs Canada, in collaboration with the Department of National Defense and academic partners, developed and implemented a matrix game aimed at prompting critical reflection and gender-based analysis on infectious disease outbreak preparedness and response. This commentary, written by the core development team, reflects on the process and outcomes of the gaming exercise, which we believe will be of interest to others hoping to promote innovative thinking and learning around global health policy and crisis response, as well as the application of serious games more broadly.	2020	NA	Globalization and Health	16	1	18	NA	10.1186/s12992-020-00547-6	5830	#5764	Smith 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Other related diseases and viruses	10.1186/s12992-020-00547-6	Department of National Defense|Department of National Defense, Government of Canada, Ottawa, Canada	('Canada', 2)
The 2019 Coronavirus: Learning Curves, Lessons, and the Weakest Link	Stein, Richard Albert	In the space of just six weeks, a new coronavirus, from a family that historically was not viewed as a global health concern, has become daily headline news around the globe. The 21(st) century marked its arrival with the emergence of three previously unknown coronaviruses. SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) was recognized in November 2002 [1, 2], MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in June 2012 [3, 4], and 2019-nCoV in December 2019 [5]. Previously, human coronaviruses, known since the 1960s, were viewed as being only marginally relevant to the clinic, except for infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals [1, 6, 7].	2020	NA	Int J Clin Pract	NA	NA	e13488-e13488	32052918	10.1111/ijcp.13488	718	#863	Stein 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/ijcp.13488	Department of Natural Sciences, LaGuardia Community College, Long Island City, NY, USA|Department of Natural Sciences, LaGuardia Community College, Long Island City, NY, USA|Institute of Medicine (US) Forum on Microbial Threats|Institute of Medicine (US)	('USA', 2)
COVID-19 and Rationally Layered Social Distancing	Stein, Richard	I would like to thank Dr. Thomson for the very pertinent and relevant points that he raised in his thoughtful letter Where are we now with COVID-19? [1]. As my response will illustrate, and in what probably will become a defining feature of conversations surrounding COVID-19 for quite some time, attempts to answer will only make room for more questions. As COVID-19 is unfolding, every day is marked by novel developments. Since the editorial went to press [2], the outbreak has expanded considerably. Over 128,000 individuals were infected worldwide as of March 13, 2020, leading to 4720 deaths [3]. In early March, while the outbreak in China appeared to start to subside [4], it started to amplify in Europe and the United States. The first fatality in the United States occurred on February 29, 2020 in a suburb of Seattle. On March 4m the first death was reported outside WA state, in CA, and was the 11(th) death in the United States. On March 6, the first two fatalities were reported in Florida. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic [5].	2020	NA	International journal of clinical practice	NA	NA	e13501-e13501	NA	10.1111/ijcp.13501	8738	#8492	Stein 2020	NA	* Normative guidance; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/ijcp.13501	Department of Natural Sciences, LaGuardia Community College, Long Island City, NY, USA|Department of Natural Sciences, LaGuardia Community College, Long Island City, NY, USA|University JH	('USA', 2)

Clinical analysis of 10 neonates born to mothers with 2019-nCoV pneumonia	Zhu, Huaping; Wang, Lin; Fang, Chengzhi; Peng, Sicong; Zhang, Lianhong; Chang, Guiping; Xia, Shiwen; Zhou, Wenhao	BACKGROUND: The newly identified 2019-nCoV, which appears to have originated in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in central China, is spreading rapidly nationwide. A number of cases of neonates born to mothers with 2019-nCoV pneumonia have been recorded. However, the clinical features of these cases have not been reported, and there is no sufficient evidence for the proper prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infections in neonates. METHODS: The clinical features and outcomes of 10 neonates (including 2 twins) born to 9 mothers with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in 5 hospitals from January 20 to February 5, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Among these 9 pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, onset of clinical symptoms occurred before delivery in 4 cases, on the day of delivery in 2 cases, and after delivery in 3 cases. In most cases, fever and a cough were the first symptoms experienced, and 1 patient also had diarrhea. Of the newborns born to these mothers, 8 were male and 2 were female; 4 were full-term infants and 6 were born premature; 2 were small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants and 1 was a large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infant; there were 8 singletons and 2 twins. Of the neonates, 6 had a Pediatric Critical Illness Score (PCIS) score of less than 90. Clinically, the first symptom in the neonates was shortness of breath (n=6), but other initial symptoms such as fever (n=2), thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function (n=2), rapid heart rate (n=1), vomiting (n=1), and pneumothorax (n=1) were observed. Up to now, 5 neonates have been cured and discharged, 1 has died, and 4 neonates remain in hospital in a stable condition. Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from 9 of the 10 neonates 1 to 9 days after birth for nucleic acid amplification tests for 2019-nCoV, all of which showed negative results. CONCLUSIONS: Perinatal 2019-nCoV infection may have adverse effects on newborns, causing problems such as fetal distress, premature labor, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function, and even death. However, vertical transmission of 2019-nCoV is yet to be confirmed.	2020	NA	Transl Pediatr	9	1	51-60	32154135	10.21037/tp.2020.02.06	6318	#6214	Zhu 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Infection prevention and control	10.21037/tp.2020.02.06	Department of Neonatology, |Department of Neonatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, |Department of Neonatology, |Department of Neonatology, Tianmen First People‚Äôs Hospital, Tianmen |Department of Pediatrics, Jingzhou Municipal Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Jingzhou |Department of Neonatology, 	NA
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and neonate: What neonatologist need to know	Lu, Qi; Shi, Yuan	Abstract Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause china epidemics with high morbidity and mortality, the infection has been transmitted to other countries. About 3 neonates and more than 230 children cases are reported. The disease condition of mainly children was mild. There is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2can be transmitted transplacentally from mother to the newborn. The treatment strategy for children with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is based on adult experience. Thus far, no deaths have been reported in the paediatric age group.

The potential risk of kidney vulnerable to novel coronavirus 2019 infection	Zhang, Fan; Liang, Yumei	OBJECTIVE. This study aims to assess correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution and CT scores as based on findings from sequential chest CT examinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Thirty patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis underwent chest CT examinations. Five patients who did not have positive CT findings or who had not yet fulfilled criteria for discharge from the hospital were excluded. CT scores were determined according to CT findings and lung involvement. The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment was recorded for each patient, and on the basis of this information, patients with COVID-19 were divided into group 1 (patients for whom this interval was â‰¤ 3 days) and group 2 (those for whom this interval was > 3 days). The CT scores for each group were fitted using a Lorentzian line-shape curve to show the variation tendency during treatment. The differences in age, sex, and last CT scores determined before discharge between the two groups were analyzed, and correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution as well as with the highest CT score also underwent statistical analysis. RESULTS. A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in the study. The fitted tendency curves for group 1 and group 2 were significantly different, with peak points showing that the estimated highest CT score was 10 and 16 for each group, respectively, and the time to disease resolution was 6 and 13 days, respectively. The Mann-Whitney test showed that the last CT scores were lower for group 1 than for group 2 (p = 0.025), although the chi-square test found no difference in age and sex between the groups. The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment had a positive correlation with the time to disease resolution (r = 0.93; p = 0.000) as well as with the highest CT score (r = 0.83; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION. Timely diagnosis and treatment are key to providing a better prognosis for patients with COVID-19.	2020	NA	American journal of physiology.

The 2019 novel cornoavirus pneumonia with onset of oculomotor nerve palsy: a case study	Wei, Heng; Yin, Hongxiang; Huang, Min; Guo, Zhenli	On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology have been reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China [1,2,3]. On January 7, 2020, Chinese health authorities confirmed that these cases were associated with a novel coronavirus, which was subsequently named 2019Â­nCoV by WHO [4]. Previous study [5] reported that virus infection can cause several neurological complications, including polyneuritis, Guillainâ€“Barre syndrome (GBS), meningitis, encephalomyelitis, and encephalopathy. We describe a rare case of 2019-CoV infection and acute unilateral isolated oculomotor nerve palsy. In this case, the diagnosis was made based on the chest computed CT manifestations and throat swab sample test. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our department with a 5-day history of persistent diplopia and a droopy left eyelid. During initial hospital assessment, he endorsed limb weakness and poor spirit. He denied any fever, neck stiffness, headache, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or photophobia. He had a history of alcohol and tobacco use, type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension (both well controlled by drugs), and lacunar infarction (without sequela).DA - 2020/02/25	2020	NA	Journal of Neurology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s00415-020-09773-9	1069	#1918	Wei 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s00415-020-09773-9	Department of Neurology, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, 430000, China|Department of Endocrinology, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, 430000, China	('China', 2)

Clinical features of severe pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan: a single centerâ€™s observational study	Sun, Dan; Li, Hui; Lu, Xiao-Xia; Xiao, Han; Ren, Jie; Zhang, Fu-Rong; Liu, Zhi-Sheng	An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China. People of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No information on severe pediatric patients with COVID-19 has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19. We included eight severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Childrenâ€™s Hospital from January 24 to February 24. We collected information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19. The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2Â monthsÂ to 15Â years; six were boys. The most common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8) and cough (6/8). Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in seven patients and ground-glass opacity in six. Laboratory findings revealed normal or increased whole blood counts (7/8), increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8). Other findings included decreased CD16â€‰+â€‰CD56 (4/8) and Th/Ts*(1/8), increased CD3 (2/8), CD4 (4/8) and CD8 (1/8), IL-6 (2/8), IL-10 (5/8) and IFN-Î³ (2/8). Treatment modalities were focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Two critically ill patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Up to February 24, 2020, three patients remained under treatment in ICU, the other five recovered and were discharged home. In this series of severe pediatric patients in Wuhan, polypnea was the most common symptom, followed by fever and cough. Common imaging changes included multiple patch-like shadows and ground-glass opacity; andÂ a cytokine storm was found in these patients, which appeared more serious in critically ill patients.	2020	NA	World Journal of Pediatrics	NA	NA	9-Jan	NA	10.1007/s12519-020-00354-4	10274	#9970	Sun 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s12519-020-00354-4	Department of Neurology, Wuhan Children‚Äôs Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430015, China|Department of Hematology, Wuhan Children‚Äôs Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430015, China|Department of Intensive Care Unit, Wuhan Children‚Äôs Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430015, China|Department of Respiratory, Wuhan Children‚Äôs Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430015, China|Institute of Maternal and Child Health, Wuhan Children‚Äôs Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University and Technology, Wuhan, 430015, China	('China', 5)

Potential Interventions for Novel Coronavirus in China: A Systematic Review	Zhang, Lei; Liu, Yunhui	An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or 2019-CoV) infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy. In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable. This article is protected by copyright.

Preliminary Recommendations for Surgical Practice of Neurosurgery Department in the Central Epidemic Area of 2019 Coronavirus Infection	Tan, Yu-tang; Wang, Jun-wen; Zhao, Kai; Han, Lin; Zhang, Hua-qiu; Niu, Hong-quan; Shu, Kai; Lei, Ting	Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed significant threats to the public health and life in China. Unlike the other 6 identified coronaviruses, the SARS-Cov-2 has a high infectious rate, a long incubation period and a variety of manifestations. In the absence of effective treatments for the virus, it becomes extremely urgent to develop scientific and standardized proposals for prevention and control of virus transmission. Hereby we focused on the surgical practice in Neurosurgery Department, Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, and drafted several recommendations based on the latest relevant guidelines and our experience. These recommendations have helped us until now to achieve â€˜zero infectionâ€™ of doctors and nurses in our department, we would like to share them with other medical staff of neurosurgery to fight 2019-nCoV infection.	2020	NA	Current Medical Science	NA	NA	4-Jan	NA	10.1007/s11596-020-2173-5	16725	#15851	Tan 2020	NA	* Normative guidance; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s11596-020-2173-5	Department of Neurosurgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China	('China', 1)
Novel coronavirus and central nervous system	Sun, Tong; Guan, Junwen	Abstract An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan has rapidly spread throughout China and has now become a global public health concern. As of the early March, a total of 100,000 cases have been confirmed in multiple countries. Clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV that respiratory symptoms, such as cough, are the most common.[1] This is consistent with the finding that the majority of patients are virus-positive in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs suggesting it mainly invades and infects the respiratory system, a hypothesis supported by pathological data.[2] In addition, it has been reported that patients? stool has tested positive for 2019-nCoV, indicating that the virus could spread from the respiratory tract to the digestive tract, or that individuals could be infected via the faecal-oral route. However, the neuroinvasive potential of 2019-nCoV remains poorly understood.	2020	NA	European Journal of Neurology	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/ene.14227	17749	#18277	Sun 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/ene.14227	Department of Neurosurgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, P.

Facing a disruptive threat: how can a nuclear medicine service be prepared for the coronavirus outbreak 2020?	Lam, Winnie Wing-Chuen; Loke, Kelvin Siu-Hoong; Wong, Wai Yin; Ng, David Chee-Eng	The aim of this short communication is to outline our experience in policies and processes of a nuclear medicine service during the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore. We describe the key considerations of policies and processes that have been implemented in our nuclear medicine service since the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Singapore General Hospital on 23 January 2020, up to the present time. Infection control, screening of patients and visitors, segregation of risk groups, segregation of staff and service continuity plans, communication and staff welfare, using electronic platforms for multi-disciplinary meetings and tele-reporting are discussed. Since our hospital received the first patient with COVID-19 in Singapore, our centre has managed 16 COVID-19 cases to date. There has not been any healthcare worker in our institution who has contracted COVID-19 through patient contact. We have highlighted for discussion some of the policies and processes to prepare a nuclear medicine service for the COVID-19 threat.	2020	NA	European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging	NA	NA	4-Jan	NA	10.1007/s00259-020-04790-2	19166	#19581	Lam 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Infection prevention and control	10.1007/s00259-020-04790-2	Department of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Division of Radiological Sciences, Singapore General Hospital, Outram Road, Singapore, 169608, Singapore	('Singapore', 3)

F-18-FDG PET/CT findings of COVID-19: a series of four highly suspected cases	Qin, Chunxia; Liu, Fang; Yen, Tzu-Chen; Lan, Xiaoli	Purpose The aim of this case series is to illustrate the F-18-FDG PET/CT findings of patients with acute respiratory disease caused by COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. Methods We describe the F-18-FDG PET/CT results from four patients who were admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms and fever between January 13 and January 20, 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak was still unrecognized and the virus infectivity was unknown. A retrospective review of the patients' medical history, clinical and laboratory data, as well as imaging findings strongly suggested a diagnosis of COVID-19. Results All patients had peripheral ground-glass opacities and/or lung consolidations in more than two pulmonary lobes. Lung lesions were characterized by a high F-18-FDG uptake and there was evidence of lymph node involvement. Conversely, disseminated disease was absent, a finding suggesting that COVID-19 has pulmonary tropism. Conclusions Although F-18-FDG PET/CT cannot be routinely used in an emergency setting and is generally not recommended for infectious diseases, our pilot data shed light on the potential clinical utility of this imaging technique in the differential diagnosis of complex cases.	2020	NA	European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging	NA	NA	NA	WOS:000517419500001	10.1007/s00259-020-04734-w	10686	#10048	Qin 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s00259-020-04734-w	Department of Nuclear Medicine, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 1277 Jiefang Ave, Wuhan, 430022, China|Department of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Center, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan	('China', 1)

Lung lesions were characterized by a high (18)F-FDG uptake and there was evidence of lymph node involvement. Conversely, disseminated disease was absent, a finding suggesting that COVID-19 has pulmonary tropism. CONCLUSIONS: Although (18)F-FDG PET/CT cannot be routinely used in an emergency setting and is generally not recommended for infectious diseases, our pilot data shed light on the potential clinical utility of this imaging technique in the differential diagnosis of complex cases.	2020	NA	Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging	NA	NA	10.1007/s00259-020-04734-w	32088847	10.1007/s00259-020-04734-w	1157	#1781	Qin 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s00259-020-04734-w	Department of Nuclear Medicine, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 1277 Jiefang Ave, Wuhan, 430022, China|Department of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Center, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan	('China', 1)

Expert consensus on the nursing management of critically ill elderly patients with coronavirus disease 2019	Xia, Wang; Chao, Sun; Hui-xiu, Hu; Zi-xin, Wang; Hui, Wang; Hua, Peng; Jian-hong, Qiao; Lan, Gao	Abstract The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first detected from patients with pneumonia of an unknown cause in Wuhan in December 2019. It has since been confirmed as the pathogen for the new coronavirus pneumonia, recently named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO. Although the general population is commonly susceptible to the disease, infected elderly people show fast progression and severe manifestations with a high proportion in critical condition as a result of compromised immunity and underlying diseases. In order to improve the quality of nursing, reduce complications and decrease mortality of critically ill elderly patients , we assembled a national expert group with expertise in critical nursing to write this consensus, based on a literature review and a subsequent panel discussion. The consensus covers the assessment, clinical nursing, discharge care and other aspects of care for critically ill elderly patients with COVID-19, aiming to share insights and provide guidance for clinical practice.	2020	NA	AGING MEDICINE	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/agm2.12107	26106	#23151	Xia 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/agm2.12107	Department of Nursing, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China|Department of Nursing, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China|Department of Nursing, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China|Department of Respiratory & Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China|Department of Nursing, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to the Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Nursing, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China|Department of Nursing, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, China|Department of Neurology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China|Department of Nursing, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China|Department of Nursing, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China|Department of Nursing, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China|Department of Respiratory & Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China|Department of Nursing, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to the Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Nursing, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China|Department of Nursing, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, China|Department of Neurology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China	('China', 16)
Difference of coagulation features between severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 and non-SARS-CoV2	Yin, Shiyu; Huang, Ming; Li, Dengju; Tang, Ning	Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is commonly complicated with coagulopathy, the difference of coagulation features between severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 and non-SARS-CoV2 has not been analyzed. Coagulation results and clinical features of consecutive patients with severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 (COVID group) and non-SARS-CoV2 (non-COVID group) in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analyzed and compared. Whether patients with elevated D-dimer could benefit from anticoagulant treatment was evaluated. There were 449 COVID patients and 104 non-COVID patients enrolled into the study. The 28-day mortality in COVID group was approximately twofold of mortality in non-COVID group (29.8% vs. 15.4%, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.003), COVID group were older (65.1â€‰Â±â€‰12.0 vs. 58.4â€‰Â±â€‰18.0, years, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and with higher platelet count (215â€‰Â±â€‰100 vs. 188â€‰Â±â€‰98, Ã—109/L, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.015), comparing to non-COVID group. The 28-day mortality of heparin users were lower than nonusers In COVID group with D-dimerâ€‰>â€‰3.0 Î¼g/mL (32.8% vs. 52.4%, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.017). Patients with severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 had higher platelet count than those induced by non-SARS-CoV2, and only the former with markedly elevated D-dimer may benefit from anticoagulant treatment.	2020	NA	Journal of Thrombosis and Thrombolysis	NA	NA	4-Jan	NA	10.1007/s11239-020-02105-8	30962	#31241	Yin 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s11239-020-02105-8	Department of Nursing, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China	('China', 3)

Lung ultrasound and computed tomographic findings in pregnant woman with COVID-19	Kalafat, E.; Yaprak, E.; Cinar, G.; Varli, B.; Ozisik, S.; Uzun, C.; Azap, A.; Koc, A.	Imaging modalities play a crucial role in the management of suspected COVID-19-infected patients. Before reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results are positive, 60-93% of patients have positive chest computed tomographic (CT) findings consistent with COVID-19 infection. We report a case of positive lung ultrasound findings consistent with COVID-19 in a woman with an initial negative RT-PCR result. The lung ultrasound-imaging findings were present between the negative and subsequent positive RT-PCR tests and correlated with CT findings. The point-of-care lung-ultrasound examination was easy to perform and, as such, could play an important role in the triage of women with suspected COVID-19. The neonatal swabs, cord blood, and placental swab RT-PCR tests were negative for SARS-CoV-2, a finding consistent with the published literature suggesting no vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women.

Novel coronavirus infection and pregnancy	Yang, H.; Wang, C.; Poon, L. C.	Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy Due to the physiological changes in their immune and cardiopulmonary systems, pregnant women are more likely to develop severe illness after infection with respiratory viruses. In 2009, pregnant women accounted for 1% of patients infected with influenza A subtype H1N1 virus, but they accounted for 5% of all H1N1-related deaths6. In addition, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), two notable strains of the coronavirus family, are both known to be responsible for severe complications during pregnancy, including the need for endotracheal intubation, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), renal failure and death7, 8. Interestingly, the impact of COVID-19 infection on pregnant women appears to be less severe. Chen et al.9 reported the clinical characteristics of nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the third trimester, which comprised mainly fever and cough. Other symptoms included myalgia, malaise, sore throat, diarrhea and shortness of breath. Data from laboratory tests showed that the majority of patients had lymphopenia and increased C-reactive protein, and chest CT scans showed multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs. Pregnancy complications that appeared after the onset of COVID-19 infection included fetal distress in two of nine patients and premature rupture of the membranes in two of nine patients. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. Another series10 of nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting from mid-trimester onwards, or during the postpartum period, reported similar findings except for one woman requiring ICU care and ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome after the infection was diagnosed 2?days postpartum. In general, both studies reported that the clinical characteristics of the pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were similar to those of non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia2-4. These observations are also in line with what has been learned about COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy in several other hospitals in Wuhan, China. Pregnant healthcare professionals should follow risk-assessment and infection-control guidelines following exposure to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

Clinical analysis of pregnant women with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia	Chen, Siyu; Liao, E.; Shao, Yong	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pregnant women infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and provide help for clinical prevention and treatment. METHODS: All 5 cases of pregnant women confirmed COVID-19 were collected among patients who admitted in Maternal and Child Hospital of Hubei Province between January 20 and February 10, 2020. RESULTS: All patients, aging from 25 to 31 years old, had the gestational week from 38th weeks to 41st weeks. All pregnant women did not have an antepartum fever but developed a low-grade fever (37.5-38.5â„ƒ) within 24 hours after delivery. All patients had normal liver and renal function, two patients had elevated plasma levels of the myocardial enzyme. Unusual chest imaging manifestations, featured with ground-grass opacity, were frequently observed in bilateral (3 cases) or unilateral lobe (2 cases) by computed tomography (CT) scan. All labors smoothly processed, the Apgar scores were 10 one and five minutes after delivery, no complications were observed in the newborn. INTERPRETATION: Pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of patients with COVID-19 should receive more attention. It is probable that pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 have no fever before delivery. Their primary initial manifestations were merely low-grade postpartum fever or mild respiratory symptoms. Therefore, the protective measures are necessary on admission; the instant CT scan and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay should be helpful in early diagnosis and avoid cross-infection on the occasion that patients have fever and other respiratory signs.

METHODS: On February 5, 2020, a multidisciplinary teleconference comprising Chinese physicians and researchers was held and medical management strategies of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy were discussed. RESULTS: Ten key recommendations were provided for the management of COVID-19 infections in pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Currently, there is no clear evidence regarding optimal delivery timing, the safety of vaginal delivery, or whether cesarean delivery prevents vertical transmission at the time of delivery; therefore, route of delivery and delivery timing should be individualized based on obstetrical indications and maternal-fetal status.	2020	NA	International journal of gynaecology and

Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 After Gynecologic Oncology Surgery in Three Women: A Retrospective Review of Medical Records	Yang, Shouhua; Zhang, Yuan; Cai, Jing; Wang, Zehua	From a large medical center in Wuhan, the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we report clinical features and prognosis for three women diagnosed with COVID-19 after gynecologic oncology surgery and hospitalized in January 2020. The incidence of COVID-19 was 0.77% (3 of 389) of total hospitalizations and 1.59% (3 of 189) of patients undergoing surgeries in the ward. The infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may be related to the older age, comorbidities, malignant tumor, and surgery in gynecologic hospitalizations. By February 20, 2020, only two of the three patients had met the clinical discharge criteria. Given the long and uncertain incubation period of COVID-19, screening for the virus infection should be carried out for all patients, both preoperatively and postoperatively. Postponement of scheduled gynecologic surgery for patients in the epidemic area should be considered.	2020	NA	The oncologist	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1634/theoncologist.2020-0157	37892	#38316	Yang 2020	NA	NA	10.1634/theoncologist.2020-0157	Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 People's Republic of China|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 People's Republic of China|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 People's Republic of China|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 People's Republic of China|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 People's Republic of China|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 People's Republic of China|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 People's Republic of China|Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022 People's Republic of China	('China', 8)

How young patients with cancer perceive the Covid-19 (coronavirus) epidemic in Milan, Italy: is there room for other fears?	Casanova, Michela; Bagliacca, Elena Pagani; Silva, Matteo; Patriarca, Carlo; Veneroni, Laura; Clerici, Carlo Alfredo; Spreafico, Filippo; Luksch, Roberto; Terenziani, Monica; Meazza, Cristina; Podda, Marta; Biassoni, Veronica; Schiavello, Elisabetta; Chiaravalli, Stefano; Puma, Nadia; Bergamaschi, Luca; Gattuso, Giovanna; Sironi, Giovanna; Massimino, Maura; Ferrari, Andrea	ABSTRACT The rapid spread of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, in particular in the Milan focal point, required drastic measures and led to panic in the population. While in our centre we did not change our approach to the treatment of our young cancer patients, we developed a qualitative survey to assess their perception of the risk and level of stress. The survey showed that a relatively large proportion of them felt personally at risk of severe complications. We believe that we need to adequately inform our patients, focusing on hygienic measures and personal protection and prompt reporting of any suspicious symptoms.

Research disruptions and recovery	Lee, Matthew; Brown, Steven; Moug, Susan; Vimalachandran, Dale; Acheson, Austin	Abstract With the pandemic of COVID-19, the routine work of surgeons has been reduced to release resources to critical care and other functions. This is necessary and right, in order to protect the health of our communities now. As a consequence, many of us who undertake clinical research have seen our work suspended. With a rich portfolio of colorectal research, this includes studies such as ROSSINI2, PITSTOP, & MASH, and has delayed the start of other important studies such as ELF 2 and Damascus]. When we return to something akin to normality, we shall be looking to re-establish the studies in a timely manner. Funders have generally been flexible with regards to the disruption and have provided guidance on how the disruption might be managed1. There is no doubt that they may be asked to provide additional support for studies in progress, which may impact future funding opportunities.	2020	NA	Colorectal Disease	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/codi.15069	45169	#42132	Lee 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/codi.15069	Department of Oncology and Metabolis, The Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK, S10 2RX|Department of Oncology and Metabolis, The Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK, S10 2RX	('UK', 2)
Outcome of Oncology Patients Infected With Coronavirus	Jazieh, A. R.; Alenazi, T. H.; Alhejazi, A.; Al Safi, F.; Al Olayan, A.	PURPOSE: This study investigated the features of oncology patients with confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) at the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs-Riyadh during the outbreak of June 2015 to determine the clinical course and outcome of affected patients. METHODS: The patients' demographic information, cancer history, treatment pattern, information about MERS-coronavirus (CoV) infection, history of travel, clinical symptoms, test results, and outcome were collected and analyzed as part of a quality improvement project to improve the care and safety of our patients. Only patients with confirmed infection were included. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were identified, with a median age of 66 years (range, 16-88 years), and 12 patients (63%) were males. The most common underlying disease was hematologic malignancies (47.4%), followed by colorectal cancer (21%) and lung cancer (15.8%). Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities (57.9% and 52.6%, respectively). Infection was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal swab in all patients. All patients contracted the infection during their hospitalization for other reasons. Sixteen patients (80%) were admitted to the intensive care unit; 13 patients (81%) had acute respiratory distress syndrome, 11 were intubated (68.75%), 9 had acute renal injury (56.25%), and 3 required dialysis (18.75%). Only 3 patients (15.8%) with early-stage cancers survived. Patients with hematologic malignancies and advanced solid tumors had a 100% case fatality rate. The majority of the causes of death were due to multi-organ failure and septic shock. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV infection resulted in a high case fatality rate in patients with malignancy. Therefore, it is critical to implement effective primary preventive measures to avoid exposure of patients with cancer to the virus.	2020	NA	JCO global oncology	6	NA	471-475	32196389	10.1200/go.20.00064	11657	#11409	Jazieh 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1200/go.20.00064	Department of Oncology, King Abdulaziz Medical City, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia	('Saudi Arabia', 1)
Managing Oncology Services During a Major Coronavirus Outbreak: Lessons From the Saudi Arabia Experience	Jazieh, A. R.; Al Hadab, A.; Al Olayan, A.; AlHejazi, A.; Al Safi, F.; Al Qarni, A.; Farooqui, F.; Al Mutairi, N.; Alenazi, T. H.	Outbreaks of infectious etiology, particularly those caused by a novel virus that has no known treatment or vaccine, may result in the interruption of medical care provided to patients with cancer and put them at risk for undertreatment in addition to the risk of being exposed to infection, a life-threatening event among patients with cancer. This article describes the approach used to manage patients with cancer during a large-scale Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus hospital outbreak in Saudi Arabia to ensure continuity of care and minimize harm from treatment interruption or acquiring infection. The approach taken toward managing this high-risk situation (COVID-19) could be easily adopted by health care organizations and would be helpful to ensure readiness for the occurrence of future outbreaks of different infectious etiologies like those recent episodes of new coronavirus.	2020	NA	JCO global oncology	6	NA	518-524	32216653	10.1200/go.20.00063	18643	#18719	Jazieh 2020	NA	* Case study/series; * Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1200/go.20.00063	Department of Oncology, King Abdulaziz Medical City, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia	('Saudi Arabia', 1)

Therapeutic Potential for Tetracyclines in the Treatment of COVID-19	Sodhi, Mohit; Etminan, Mahyar	Abstract Currently there is a race against time to identify prophylactic and therapeutic treatments against COVID-19. Until these treatments are developed, tested and mass produced, it might be prudent to look into existing therapies that could be effective against this virus. Based on the available evidence we believe that tetracyclines may be effective agents in the treatment of COVID-19. Tetracyclines (e.g. tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline) are highly lipophilic antibiotics that are known to chelate zinc compounds on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1. Coronaviruses are also known to heavily rely on host MMPs for survival, cell infiltration, cell to cell adhesion, and replication, many of which have zinc as part of their MMP complex2,3. It is possible that the zinc chelating properties of tetracyclines may also aid in inhibiting COVID-19 infection in humans limiting their ability to replicate within the host.	2020	NA	Pharmacotherapy: The Journal of Human Pharmacology and Drug Therapy	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/phar.2395	45185	#42039	Sodhi 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/phar.2395	Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada|Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada|Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Columbia, Canada|Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Columbia, Canada|Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada|Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada|Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Columbia, Canada|Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Columbia, Canada	('Canada', 8)

Precautionary measures needed for ophthalmologists during pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)	Wan, Kelvin H.; Huang, Suber S.; Young, Alvin; Chiu Lam, Dennis Shun	The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China has spread to over 113 countries with 118,326 infected and 4,292 died as of 11 March 2020 and the World Health Organization (WHO) has just announced COVID-19 a global pandemic. A person under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 is less likely to present initially to the ophthalmologists compared to emergency care or internal medicine physicians. However, in late February 2020, 2 patients presented simultaneously to our eye casualty with sudden onset of unilateral painful red eye associated with a decline in visual acuity, their intraocular pressure (IOP) were over 40 mmHg and slit-lamp examination findings were suggestive of acute primary angle closure (APAC).	2020	NA	Acta ophthalmologica	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/aos.14438	19096	#19401	Wan 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/aos.14438	Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong|Department of Ophthalmology, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong, Hong Kong|Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong|Department of Ophthalmology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong, Hong Kong|Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong|Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong|Department of Ophthalmology, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong, Hong Kong|Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong|Department of Ophthalmology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong, Hong Kong|Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong	NA

Revisiting the dangers of the coronavirus in the ophthalmology practice	Seah, Ivan; Su, Xinyi; Lingam, Gopal	A possible threat in the ophthalmology clinic While the 2019-nCoV transmission route is still unknown, countries have been preparing measures based on past experiences with coronaviruses namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These viruses transmit primarily through droplets and other bodily secretions. In the ophthalmology practice, healthcare workers may be particularly susceptible to these infections. Firstly, ophthalmologists are extremely reliant on physical examination during patient consultation. Of particular concern is the proximity between the patient and ophthalmologist during the slit lamp microscope examination. It has been shown that droplets from a cough or sneeze can be propelled for up to 6?m [8], a range that definitely encompasses the distance between the patient and ophthalmologist. Secondly, during the SARS-CoV epidemic, clinical reports have suggested tears as a medium of infection. In a case series by Loon et al., it was shown that viral RNA of the SARS-CoV can be detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the tears of infected individuals [9]. While anecdotal in nature, such accounts highlight the possible infectivity of tears, a fluid which ophthalmologists and instruments come in contact on a daily basis. If true, this represents a crucial need for further development of disinfection and personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols for the ophthalmology clinic.SN - 1476-5454	2020	NA	Eye	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1038/s41433-020-0790-7	636	#375	Seah 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Infection prevention and control	10.1038/s41433-020-0790-7	Department of Ophthalmology, National University Hospital, Singapore, Singapore|Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, Singapore|Department of Ophthalmology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University Singapore, Singapore, Singapore	('Singapore', 7)

Eyes on New Product Development	Novack, Gary D.	In this period, a long-used topical ocular antihistamine was approved for switching from prescription to over-the-counter, new treatments continue to be evaluated in the treatment of dry eye and external diseases, and novel drug delivery systems are being evaluated in the clinic for the treatment of retinal diseases. Clinical trials for gene and cell therapies continue, although with a possible warning about safety issues for some therapies considering the COVID-19 (corona virus) outbreak. Approvals for novel therapeutics continue worldwide, providing more options for ophthalmic treatment. Regulatory and public policy issues include the application of laws and regulations for treatments for orphan diseases, selection of brand names, the use of animals in safety testing, and the quality of real-world data for drug approval. Two firms are collaborating on the use of digital technologies to ophthalmic therapeutics. Finally, the impact of â€œpredatory journalsâ€ in the scientific community may be minimal.

Evaluation of coronavirus in tears and conjunctival secretions of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection	Xia, Jianhua; Tong, Jianping; Liu, Mengyun; Shen, Ye; Guo, Dongyu	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the presence of novel coronavirus in tears and conjunctival secretions of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. METHODS: A prospective interventional case series study was performed, and 30 confirmed novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) patients were selected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from January 26, 2020 to February 9, 2020. At an interval of 2-3 days, tear and conjunctival secretions were collected twice with disposable sampling swabs for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. RESULTS: 21 common type and 9 severe type NCP patients were enrolled. Two samples of tear and conjunctival secretions were obtained from the only one patient with conjunctivitis yielded positive RT-PCR results. 58 samples from other patents were all negative. CONCLUSION: We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions in NCP patients with conjunctivitis. This article is protected by copyright.

Survey of COVID-19 Disease Among Orthopaedic Surgeons in Wuhan, Peopleâ€™s Republic of China	Guo, Xiaodong; Wang, Jiedong; Hu, Dong; Wu, Lisha; Gu, Li; Wang, Yang; Zhao, Jingjing; Zeng, Lian; Zhang, Jianduan; Wu, Yongchao	Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, in December 2019 and now is a pandemic all around the world. Some orthopaedic surgeons in Wuhan were infected with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a survey to identify the orthopaedic surgeons who were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to collect information such as social demographic variables, clinical manifestations, exposure history, awareness of the outbreak, infection control training provided by hospitals, and individual protection practices. To further explore the possible risk factors at the individual level, a 1:2 matched case-control study was conducted. Results: A total of 26 orthopaedic surgeons from 8 hospitals in Wuhan were identified as having COVID-19. The incidence in each hospital varied from 1.5% to 20.7%. The onset of symptoms was from January 13 to February 5, 2020, and peaked on January 23, 8 days prior to the peak of the public epidemic. The suspected sites of exposure were general wards (79.2%), public places at the hospital (20.8%), operating rooms (12.5%), the intensive care unit (4.2%), and the outpatient clinic (4.2%). There was transmission from these doctors to others in 25% of cases, including to family members (20.8%), to colleagues (4.2%), to patients (4.2%), and to friends (4.2%). Participation in real-time training on prevention measures was found to have a protective effect against COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 0.12). Not wearing an N95 respirator was found to be a risk factor (OR, 5.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09 to 25.00]). Wearing respirators or masks all of the time was found to be protective (OR, 0.15). Severe fatigue was found to be a risk factor (OR, 4 [95% CI, 1 to 16]) for infection with COVID-19. Conclusions: Orthopaedic surgeons are at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Common places of work could be contaminated. Orthopaedic surgeons have to be more vigilant and take more precautions to avoid infection with COVID-19. Level of Evidence: Diagnostic Level IV.

Characteristics and Early Prognosis of COVID-19 Infection in Fracture Patients	Mi, Bobin; Chen, Lang; Xiong, Yuan; Xue, Hang; Zhou, Wu; Liu, Guohui	Background: Studies of the novel coronavirus-induced disease COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, have elucidated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this disease in the general population. The present investigation summarizes the clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of patients with fractures. Methods: Data on 10 patients with a fracture and COVID-19 were collected from 8 different hospitals located in the Hubei province from January 1, 2020, to February 27, 2020. Analyses of early prognosis were based on clinical outcomes and trends in laboratory results during treatment. Results: All 10 patients presented with limited activity related to the fracture. The most common signs were fever, cough, and fatigue at the time of presentation (7 patients each). Other, less common signs included sore throat (4 patients), dyspnea (5 patients), chest pain (1 patient), nasal congestion (1 patient), headache (1 patient), dizziness (3 patients), abdominal pain (1 patient), and vomiting (1 patient). Lymphopenia (<1.0 Ã— 109 cells/L) was identified in 6 of 10 patients, 9 of 9 patients had a high serum level of D-dimer, and 9 of 9 patients had a high level of C-reactive protein. Three patients underwent surgery, whereas the others were managed nonoperatively because of their compromised status. Four patients died on day 8 (3 patients) or day 14 (1 patient) after admission. The clinical outcomes for the surviving patients are not yet determined. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fracture tended to be more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fracture. This finding may be related to the duration between the development of symptoms and presentation. Surgical treatment should be carried out cautiously or nonoperative care should be chosen for patients with fracture in COVID-19-affected areas, especially older individuals with intertrochanteric fractures. Level of Evidence: Prognostic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence. Email address for W. Zhou: wuzhoutjmu1986@163.com Email address for Y.

Peer-to-Peer Contact Tracing: Development of a Privacy-Preserving Smartphone App	Yasaka, Tyler M.; Lehrich, Brandon M.; Sahyouni, Ronald	BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an urgent public health crisis, with epidemiologic models predicting severe consequences, including high death rates, if the virus is permitted to run its course without any intervention or response. Contact tracing using smartphone technology is a powerful tool that may be employed to limit disease transmission during an epidemic or pandemic; yet, contact tracing apps present significant privacy concerns regarding the collection of personal data such as location. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing smartphone app that respects user privacy by not collecting location information or other personal data. METHODS: We propose the use of an anonymized graph of interpersonal interactions to conduct a novel form of contact tracing and have developed a proof-of-concept smartphone app that implements this approach. Additionally, we developed a computer simulation model that demonstrates the impact of our proposal on epidemic or pandemic outbreak trajectories across multiple rates of adoption. RESULTS: Our proof-of-concept smartphone app allows users to create "checkpoints" for contact tracing, check their risk level based on their past interactions, and anonymously self-report a positive status to their peer network. Our simulation results suggest that higher adoption rates of such an app may result in a better controlled epidemic or pandemic outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed smartphone-based contact tracing method presents a novel solution that preserves privacy while demonstrating the potential to suppress an epidemic or pandemic outbreak. This app could potentially be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics in the future to achieve a middle ground between drastic isolation measures and unmitigated disease spread.	2020	NA	JMIR mHealth and uHealth	8	4	e18936-e18936	NA	10.2196/18936	37893	#38768	Yasaka 2020	NA	NA	10.2196/18936	Department of Otolaryngology ‚Äì Head and Neck Surgery, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States|Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States|Department of Otolaryngology ‚Äì Head and Neck Surgery|University of California, Irvine	('United States', 2)

Endonasal instrumentation and aerosolization risk in the era of COVID-19: simulation, literature review, and proposed mitigation strategies	Workman, Alan D.; Welling, D. Bradley; Carter, Bob S.; Curry, William T.; Holbrook, Eric H.; Gray, Stacey T.; Scangas, George A.; Bleier, Benjamin S.	Abstract Introduction : International experience with COVID-19 suggests it poses a significant risk of infectious transmission to skull base surgeons, due to high nasal viral titers and the unknown potential for aerosol generation during endonasal instrumentation. The purpose of this study was to simulate aerosolization events over a range of endoscopic procedures to gain an evidence-basedÂ aerosolÂ risk assessment. Methods : Aerosolization was simulated in a cadaver using fluorescein solution (0.2mg/10ml) and quantified using a blue-light filter and digital image processing. Outpatient sneezing during endoscopy was simulated using an intranasal atomizer in the presence or absence of intact and modified surgical mask barriers. Surgical aerosolization was simulated during non-powered instrumentation, suction microdebrider, and high-speed drilling following nasal fluorescein application. Results : Among the outpatient conditions, a simulated sneeze event generated maximal aerosol distribution at 30cm extending to 66cm. Both an intact surgical mask and a modified VENT mask (which enables endoscopy) eliminated all detectable aerosol spread. Among the surgical conditions, cold instrumentation and microdebrider use did not generate detectable aerosols. Conversely, use of a high-speed drill produced significant aerosol contamination in all tested conditions. Conclusion : We confirm that aerosolization presents aÂ risk to the endonasalÂ skull base surgeon. In the outpatient setting, use of a barrier significantly reduces aerosol spread. Cold surgical instrumentation and microdebrider use pose significantly lessÂ aerosolizationÂ risk than a high-speed drill. Procedures requiring drill use should carry a special designation as an ?Aerosol Generating Surgery? to convey this unique risk, andÂ supportÂ the need for protectiveÂ PPE.

Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Characteristics in children and considerations for Dentists providing their care	Mallineni, S. K.; Innes, N. P.; Raggio, D. P.; Araujo, M. P.; Robertson, M. D.; Jayaraman, J.	Abstract The emergence of the novel virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has caused a global pandemic called Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and has become one of the most significant challenges to the healthcare profession. Dental practices are focal points for cross-infection and care must be taken to minimise the risk of infection to, from, or between dental care professionals and patients. The COVID-19 disease epidemiological and clinical characteristics are still being collated but children?s symptoms seem to be milder than those that adults experience. It is unknown whether certain groups, for example, children with comorbidities, might be at a higher risk of more severe illness. Emerging data on disease spread in children, affected by COVID-19 has not been presented in detail. The purpose of this article is to report current data on the paediatric population affected with COVID-19 and highlight considerations for dentists providing care for children during this pandemic. All members of the dental team have a professional responsibility to keep themselves informed of current guidance and be vigilant in updating themselves as recommendations are changing so quickly.	2020	NA	International Journal of Paediatric Dentistry	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/ipd.12653	34451	#34886	Mallineni 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/ipd.12653	Department of Paediatric Dentistry, School of Dentistry, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil|Department of Developmental Dentistry, University of Texas Health School of Dentistry, San Antonio, TX, USA|Department of Paediatric Dentistry, School of Dentistry, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil|Department of Developmental Dentistry, University of Texas Health School of Dentistry, San Antonio, TX, USA	('Brazil', 2)|('USA', 2)

COVID-19 infection in a paucisymptomatic infant: Raising the index of suspicion in epidemic settings	Canarutto, Daniele; Priolo, Alessio; Russo, Gianni; Pitea, Marco; Vigone, Maria Cristina; Barera, Graziano	Few children have been reported to have been affected by novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); it is unclear whether children are less likely to be infected or rather display fewer symptoms. We present the case of a 32-day-old boy infected by COVID-19 that presented with an upper air way infection which resolved spontaneously and did not require any therapy. We argue that in epidemic settings children presenting with any mild symptom potentially attributable to COVID-19 should be considered contagious until proven otherwise, and that management must be guided by clinical conditions.	2020	NA	Pediatric pulmonology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1002/ppul.24754	34276	#35039	Canarutto 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/ppul.24754	Department of Paediatrics, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy|Department of Paediatrics, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy|Department of Paediatrics, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy|Department of Paediatrics, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy|Department of Paediatrics, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy|Department of Paediatrics, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy|Department of Paediatrics, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy|Department of Paediatrics, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy	('Italy', 8)

Coronavirus Susceptibility to the Antiviral Remdesivir (GS-5734) Is Mediated by the Viral Polymerase and the Proofreading Exoribonuclease	Agostini, Maria L.; Andres, Erica L.; Sims, Amy C.; Graham, Rachel L.; Sheahan, Timothy P.; Lu, Xiaotao; Smith, Everett Clinton; Case, James Brett; Feng, Joy Y.; Jordan, Robert; Ray, Adrian S.; Cihlar, Tomas; Siegel, Dustin; Mackman, Richard L.; Clarke, Michael O.; Baric, Ralph S.; Denison, Mark R.	Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe disease in humans, but no approved therapeutics are available. The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity. We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model. However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs. Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC(50)) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC(50) The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe human infections, but there are no approved antivirals to treat these infections. Development of nucleoside-based therapeutics for CoV infections has been hampered by the presence of a proofreading exoribonuclease. Here, we expand the known efficacy of the nucleotide prodrug remdesivir (GS-5734) to include a group Î²-2a CoV. Further, GS-5734 potently inhibits CoVs with intact proofreading. Following selection with the GS-5734 parent nucleoside, 2Â amino acid substitutions in the nsp12 polymerase at residues that are identical across CoVs provide low-level resistance to GS-5734. The resistance mutations decrease viral fitness of MHV in vitro and attenuate pathogenesis in a SARS-CoV animal model of infection. Together, these studies define the target of GS-5734 activity and demonstrate that resistance is difficult to select, only partial, and impairs fitness and virulence of MHV and SARS-CoV, supporting further development of GS-5734 as a potential effective pan-CoV antiviral.	2018	NA	mBio	9	2	e00221-18	29511076	10.1128/mBio.00221-18	928	#1416	Agostini 2018	NA	* Narrative review; Awaiting classification; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Other related diseases and viruses	10.1128/mBio.00221-18	Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA|Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA|Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA|Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA|Department of Biology, the University of the South, Sewanee, Tennessee, USA|Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA|Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA|Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA	('USA', 12)
Gold nanoparticle&#8208;adjuvanted S protein induces a strong antigen&#8208;specific IgG response against severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;related coronavirus infection, but fails to induce protective antibodies and limit eosinophilic infiltration in lungs	Sekimukai, Hanako; Iwata; Yoshikawa, Naoko; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Tani, Hideki; Kataoka, Michiyo; Suzuki, Tadaki; Hasegawa, Hideki; Niikura, Kenichi; Arai, Katsuhiko; Nagata, Noriyo	The spike (S) protein of coronavirus, which binds to cellular receptors and mediates membrane fusion for cell entry, is a candidate vaccine target for blocking coronavirus infection. However, some animal studies have suggested that inadequate immunization against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS&#8208;CoV) induces a lung eosinophilic immunopathology upon infection. The present study evaluated two kinds of vaccine adjuvants for use with recombinant S protein: gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which are expected to function as both an antigen carrier and an adjuvant in immunization; and Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) agonists, which have previously been shown to be an effective adjuvant in an ultraviolet&#8208;inactivated SARS&#8208;CoV vaccine. All the mice immunized with more than 0.5&#8201;Âµg S protein without adjuvant escaped from SARS after infection with mouse&#8208;adapted SARS&#8208;CoV; however, eosinophilic infiltrations were observed in the lungs of almost all the immunized mice. The AuNP&#8208;adjuvanted protein induced a strong IgG response but failed to improve vaccine efficacy or to reduce eosinophilic infiltration because of highly allergic inflammatory responses. Whereas similar virus titers were observed in the control animals and the animals immunized with S protein with or without AuNPs, Type 1 interferon and pro&#8208;inflammatory responses were moderate in the mice treated with S protein with and without AuNPs. On the other hand, the TLR agonist&#8208;adjuvanted vaccine induced highly protective antibodies without eosinophilic infiltrations, as well as Th1/17 cytokine responses. The findings of this study will support the development of vaccines against severe pneumonia&#8208;associated coronaviruses.	2020	NA	Microbiology and Immunology	64	1	33-51	NA	10.1111/1348-0421.12754	148	#70	Sekimukai 2020	NA	Vaccines; Virology, immunology	10.1111/1348-0421.12754	Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Tissue Physiology, Faculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Virology I, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Virology I, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Tissue Physiology, Faculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Tissue Physiology, Faculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Virology I, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Virology I, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Tissue Physiology, Faculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan	('Japan', 20)|('usa', 16)
Differences between COVID-19 and suspected then confirmed SARS-CoV-2-negative pneumonia: a retrospective study from a single center	Chen, Xinyi; Yang, Yi; Huang, Min; Liu, Lili; Zhang, Xianxiang; Xu, Jing; Geng, Shaoqing; Han, Bo; Xiao, Jiangfeng; Wan, Yanyun	Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019. Tens thousands of people have been infected with the disease. Our aim was to distinguish severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients from SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. We retrospectively compared the data of COVID-19 patients with those of suspected and confirmed SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (control patients). There were 78 COVID-19 patients and 26 control patients, whose median ages were significantly different (P=0.001). The percentage of COVID-19 patients admitting exposure to Wuhan was obviously higher than that of control patients (X2=29.130, P<0.001). Fever and cough appeared more frequently in COVID-19 patients than in the control patients. The routine blood work-up parameters of COVID-19 patients did not change much and their mean counts were in normal range. There were 38.5% of control patients had higher procalcitonin (PCT) levels than 0.5ng/ml, which was significantly higher than that percentage of COVID-19 patients (X2=22.636, P <0.05), and COVID-19 patients were also more likely to have decreased or normal urea and creatinine levels than control patients (X2=24.930, 8.480, P <0.05).Younger age, exposure to Wuhan, fever, cough, and slight changes in routine blood work-up parameters, urea and creatinine were important features discriminating COVID-19 from control patients. Slightly increased, but far less than 0.5ng/ml, PCT levels also differentiated COVID-19 patients from control patients This article is protected by copyright.

Evolving status of the 2019 novel coronavirus Infection: proposal of conventional serologic assays for disease diagnosis and infection monitoring [Commentary/Review]	Xiao, Shu-Yuan; Wu, Yingjie; Liu, Huan	Abstract The novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) outbreak in Wuhan, China has spread rapidly nationwide, with some cases occurring in other parts of the world. Although most patients present with mild febrile illness with patchy pulmonary inflammation, a significant portion develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a current case fatality of 2.3-3%. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and laboratory and chest radiographic findings, but confirmation currently relies on nucleic acid-based assays. The latter are playing an important role in facilitating patient isolation, treatment and assessment of infectious activities. However, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases, as well as delayed diagnosis. Furthermore, there has not been enough time to assess specificity and sensitivity. Conventional serological assays, such as enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for specific IgM and IgG antibodies, should offer a high-throughput alternative, which allows for uniform tests for all suspected patients, and can facilitate more complete identification of infected cases and avoidance of unnecessary cross infection among unselected patients.

Histopathologic Evaluation and Scoring of Viral Lung Infection	Meyerholz, David K.; Beck, Amanda P.	Emergent coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV can cause significant morbidity and mortality in infected individuals. Lung infection is a common clinical feature and contributes to disease severity as well as viral transmission. Animal models are often required to study viral infections and therapies, especially during an initial outbreak. Histopathology studies allow for identification of lesions and affected cell types to better understand viral pathogenesis and clarify effective therapies. Use of immunostaining allows detection of presumed viral receptors and viral tropism for cells can be evaluated to correlate with lesions. In the lung, lesions and immunostaining can be qualitatively described to define the cell types, microanatomic location, and type of changes seen. These features are important and necessary, but this approach can have limitations when comparing treatment groups. Semiquantitative and quantitative tissue scores are more rigorous as these provide the ability to statistically compare groups and increase the reproducibility and rigor of the study. This review describes principles, approaches, and resources that can be useful to evaluate coronavirus lung infection, focusing on MER-CoV infection as the principal example.	2020	NA	Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)	2099	NA	205-220	MEDLINE:31883098	10.1007/978-1-0716-0211-9_16	4565	#3837	Meyerholz 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/978-1-0716-0211-9_16	Department of Pathology|University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine|Department of Pathology	NA

Celebrating TB day at the time of COVID-19	Alagna, Riccardo; Besozzi, Giorgio; Codecasa, Luigi Ruffo; Gori, Andrea; Migliori, Giovanni Battista; Raviglione, Mario; Cirillo, Daniela Maria	March 24th, the tuberculosis (TB) day, is the global call to raise awareness, celebrate successes and remind the world that TB is still the NÂ°1 killer among the infectious causes of death [1]. TB is preventable and curable disease, and its control is a highly cost-effective health intervention. However, diagnostic delay and inadequate treatment contribute to the severity and mortality of the disease as well as the risk of transmission and development of drug resistance. Despite the fact that TB disproportionately impacts low- and middle- income countries, it does not spare any country in the world including those in the European Union/European Economic Area where more than 4000 of people still die for the disease every year [2]. Moreover, the high number of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB cases in some countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region poses a growing public health threat. Despite the sheer numbers, TB has for too long been overshadowed by HIV and malaria, and currently by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic.	2020	NA	The European respiratory journal	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1183/13993003.00650-2020	30664	#31164	Alagna 2020	NA	NA	10.1183/13993003.00650-2020	Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, University of Milano, Milano, Italy	('Italy', 1)
An Analysis of Spatiotemporal Pattern for COIVD-19 in China based on Space-Time Cube	Mo, Chunbao; Tan, Dechan; Mai, Tingyu; Bei, Chunhua; Qin, Jian; Pang, Weiyi; Zhang, Zhiyong	This study seeks to examine and analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of COVID-19 outbreaks and identify the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and changing trends of cases. Hence, local outlier analysis and emerging spatiotemporal hot spot analysis were performed to analyze the spatiotemporal clustering pattern and cold\hot spot trends of COVID-19 cases based on space-time cube during the period fromÂ January 23, 2020 to February 24, 2020. The main findings are as follows. 1) The outbreak had spread rapidly throughout the country within a short time and the current totality incidence rate has decreased. 2) The spatiotemporal distribution of cases was uneven. In terms of the spatiotemporal clustering pattern, Wuhan and Shiyan city were the center as both cities had high-high clustering pattern with a surrounding unstable multiple type pattern in partial areas of Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, and Chongqing city. Those regions are continuously in the hot spot on the spatiotemporal tendency. 3) The spatiotemporal analysis technology based on the space-time cube can analyze comprehensively the spatiotemporal pattern of epidemiological data and produce a visual output of the consequences, which can reflect intuitively the distribution and trend of data in space-time. Therefore, the Chinese government should strengthen the prevention and control efforts in a targeted manner to cope with a highly changeable situation. This article is protected by copyright.

Symptoms in these cases were nonspecific and no children required respiratory support or intensive care. Chest X-rays lacked definite signs of pneumonia, a defining feature of the infection in adult cases. Notably, eight children persistently tested positive on rectal swabs even after nasopharyngeal testing was negative, raising the possibility of fecal-oral transmission. Children infected with the COVID-19 outbreak coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, show mild symptoms but prolonged shedding of viral RNA in feces, suggesting that the fecal-oral route might play a role in virus transmission.	2020	NA	Nature Medicine	NA	NA	NA	WOS:000519422600001	10.1038/s41591-020-0817-4	10401	#10221	Xu 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1038/s41591-020-0817-4	Department of Pediatric, Guangzhou Women and Children‚Äôs Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Center Laboratory, Guangzhou Women and Children‚Äôs Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Medical Administration, Guangzhou Women and Children‚Äôs Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Radiology, Guangzhou Women and Children‚Äôs Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China	('China', 4)

Unique epidemiological and clinical features of the emerging 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) implicate special control measures	Wang, Yixuan; Wang, Yuyi; Chen, Yan; Qin, Qingsong	Abstract By Feb 27th, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 caused 82623 confirmed cases and 2858 deaths globally, more than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (8273 cases, 775 deaths) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (1139 cases, 431 deaths) caused in 2003 and 2013 respectively. COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally. Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Average incubation period of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0-24 days. The basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 ranges from 2-3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS. A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID-19. Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem. 3019 health workers were infected by Feb 12, 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan. Limited epidemiological and clinical data suggest that the disease spectrum of COVID-19 may differ from SARS or MERS. We summarize latest literatures on genetic, epidemiological, and clinical features of COVID-19 in comparison to SARS and MERS and emphasize special measures on diagnosis and potential interventions. This review will improve our understanding of the unique features of COVID-19 and enhance our control measures in the future. This article is protected by copyright.

A Review of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19)	Singhal, Tanu	There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality. The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.	2020	NA	Indian journal of pediatrics	NA	NA	10.1007/s12098-020-03263-6	NA	10.1007/s12098-020-03263-6	8779	#8490	Singhal 2020	NA	* Systematic review; Epidemiology	10.1007/s12098-020-03263-6	Department of Pediatrics and Infectious Disease, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital and Medical Research Institute, Mumbai, India	('India', 1)

Two cases of neonates with positive 2019-nCoV tests have been reported. Due to the immature immune system and the possibility of vertical transmission from mother to infant, neonates have become a high-risk group susceptible to 2019-nCoV, which emphasize a close cooperation from both perinatal and neonatal pediatrics. In neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), to prevent and control infection, there should be practical measures to ensure the optimal management of children potentially to be infected. According to the latest 2019-nCoV national management plan and the actual situation, the Chinese Neonatal 2019-nCoV expert working Group has put forward measures on the prevention and control of neonatal 2019-nCoV infection.	2020	NA	Annals of Translational Medicine	8	3	NA	WOS:000514545800011	10.21037/atm.2020.02.20	4460	#4170	Wang 2020	NA	Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.21037/atm.2020.02.20	Department of Pediatrics, |Department of Neonatology, |Department of Neonatology, Chengdu Women‚Äôs and Children‚Äôs Central Hospital, School of Medicine, |University of Electronic Science and Technology of China|Department of Neonatology, Shengjing Hospital, |Department of Neonatology, |Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital, |Department of Pediatrics, |Department of Neonatology, |Department of Neonatology, |Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, |Department of Neonatology, Guangdong Maternal and Children‚Äôs Hospital, |Department of Neonatology, |Department of Neonatology, Guangzhou Women and Children‚Äôs Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University Guangzhou |Department of Neonatology, the Children‚Äôs Hospital, |Department of Pediatrics, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, |University of Toronto	('China', 2)
Heart University: a new online educational forum in paediatric and adult congenital cardiac care. The future of virtual learning in a post-pandemic world?	Tretter, Justin T.; Windram, Jonathan; Faulkner, Theresa; Hudgens, Michelle; Sendzikaite, Skaiste; Blom, Nico A.; Hanseus, Katarina; Loomba, Rohit S.; McMahon, Colin J.; Zheleva, Bistra; Kumar, R. Krishna; Jacobs, Jeffrey P.; Oechslin, Erwin N.; Webb, Gary D.; Redington, Andrew N.	Online learning has become an increasingly expected and popular component for education of the modern-day adult learner, including the medical provider. In light of the recent coronavirus pandemic, there has never been more urgency to establish opportunities for supplemental online learning. Heart University aims to be â€˜the go-to online resourceâ€™ for e-learning in congenital heart disease and paediatric acquired heart disease. It is a carefully-curated open access library of pedagogical material for all providers of care to children and adults with congenital heart disease or children with acquired heart disease, whether a trainee or a practicing provider. In this manuscript, we review the aims, development, current offerings and standing, and future goals of Heart University.

Clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19: a report of two family cluster cases	Ji, Li-Na; Chao, Shuang; Wang, Yue-Jiao; Li, Xue-Jun; Mu, Xiang-Dong; Lin, Ming-Gui; Jiang, Rong-Meng	Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hasÂ spread rapidlyÂ across the globe. People of all ages are susceptible to COVID-19. However, literature reports on pediatric patients are limited. To improve the recognition of COVID-19 infection in children, we retrospectively reviewed two confirmed pediatric cases from two family clusters. Both clinical features and laboratory examinationÂ results of the children and their family members were described. The two confirmed children only presented with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Both of themÂ had normal chest CT images. After general and symptomatic treatments, both childrenÂ recovered quickly. Both families had travel histories to Hubei Province. Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are mostly owing to family cluster or with a close contact history. Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms than infected adults. We should attach importance to early recognition, early diagnosis, and early treatment of infected children.	2020	NA	World Journal of Pediatrics	NA	NA	4-Jan	NA	10.1007/s12519-020-00356-2	8967	#8764	Ji 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s12519-020-00356-2	Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital Affiliated To Tsinghua University, Litang Road No.168, Changping District, Beijing, 102218, China|Department of Respiratory Medicine, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital Affiliated To Tsinghua University, Litang Road No.168, Changping District, Beijing, 102218, China|Department of Infectious Disease, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital Affiliated To Tsinghua University, Litang Road No.168, Changping District, Beijing, 102218, China|Department of Infectious Disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital Affiliated To Capital Medical University, Jingshun East Street No.8, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100011, China	('China', 4)

Epidemiology and Clinical Features of Coronavirus disease 2019 in Children	Choi, Soo-Han; Kim, Han Wool; Kang, Ji-Man; Kim, Dong Hyun; Cho, Eun Young	Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), which started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has been declared a worldwide pandemic in March 11, 2020, is a novel infectious disease that causes respiratory illness and death. Pediatric COVID-19 accounts for a small percentage of patients with outbreaks and is often milder than adults, but can progress to severe disease in some cases. Even neonates can suffer from COVID-19, and children may play a role as a spreader in the community. In this review, we summarize what is known about COVID-19 in children and adolescents until now.	2020	NA	Clinical and experimental pediatrics	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.3345/cep.2020.00535	37789	#38675	Choi 2020	NA	NA	10.3345/cep.2020.00535	Department of Pediatrics, Hallym University Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Hwaseong, Korea|Department of Pediatrics, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Korea|Department of Pediatrics, Severance Children's Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea|Institute for Immunology and Immunological Diseases, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea|Department of Pediatrics, Inha University Hospital, Inha University School of Medicine, Incheon, Korea|Department of Pediatrics, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea	NA
Single-Dose, Intranasal Immunization with Recombinant Parainfluenza Virus 5 Expressing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Spike Protein Protects Mice from Fatal MERS-CoV Infection	Li, Kun; Li, Zhuo; Wohlford-Lenane, Christine; Meyerholz, David K.; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; An, Dong; Perlman, Stanley; McCray, Paul B.; He, Biao	<p> Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can cause severe and fatal acute respiratory disease in humans and remains endemic in the Middle East since first being identified in 2012. There are currently no approved vaccines or therapies available for MERS-CoV. In this study, we evaluated parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5)-based vaccine expressing the MERS-CoV envelope spike protein (PIV5/MERS-S) in a human DPP4 knockin C57BL/6 congenic mouse model (hDPP4 KI). Following a single-dose intranasal immunization, PIV5-MERS-S induced neutralizing antibody and robust T cell responses in hDPP4 KI mice. A single intranasal administration of 10 <sup>4</sup> PFU PIV5-MERS-S provided complete protection against a lethal challenge with mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS <sub>MA</sub> 6.1.2) and improved virus clearance in the lung. In comparison, single-dose intramuscular immunization with 10 <sup>6</sup> PFU UV-inactivated MERS <sub>MA</sub> 6.1.2 mixed with Imject alum provided protection to only 25% of immunized mice. Intriguingly, an influx of eosinophils was observed only in the lungs of mice immunized with inactivated MERS-CoV, suggestive of a hypersensitivity-type response. Overall, our study indicated that PIV5-MERS-S is a promising effective vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV infection. </p>	2020	NA	mBio	11	2	NA	NA	10.1128/mBio.00554-20	37731	#38355	Li 2020	NA	NA	10.1128/mBio.00554-20	Department of Pediatrics, Pappajohn Biomedical Institute, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA|Department of Infectious Diseases, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA|Department of Pediatrics, Pappajohn Biomedical Institute, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA|Department of Pathology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA|Department of Infectious Diseases, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA|Department of Pediatrics, Pappajohn Biomedical Institute, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA|Department of Pediatrics, Pappajohn Biomedical Institute, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA|Department of Infectious Diseases, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA	('USA', 11)|('Georgia', 6)
COVID-19 epidemic: disease characteristics in children	Jiatong, She; lanqin, Liu; Wenjun, Liu	Abstract In mid-December 2019, a disease caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which began in Wuhan, China, has spread throughout the country and many countries around the world. The number of children with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has also increased significantly. Although information regarding the epidemiology of COVID-19 in children has accumulated, relevant comprehensive reports are lacking. The present article reviews the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in children. This article is protected by copyright.

In this case study the test for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in pharyngeal swab and anal swab were compared. Case presentation A 3-month-old girl was admitted to our hospital with COVID-19. Her parents had both been diagnosed with COVID-19. The results of pharyngeal swab and anal swab of the little girl were recorded and compared during the course of the disease. The oropharyngeal specimen showed negative result for SARS-CoV-2 on the 14th day after onset of the illness. However, the anal swab was still positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the 28th day after the onset of the illness. Conclusion The possibility of fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 should be assessed. Personal hygiene during home quarantine merits considerable attention.	2020	NA	PEDIATRIC INVESTIGATION	4	1	48-50	NA	10.1002/ped4.12186	9249	#9337	Fan 2020	NA	* Case study/series; * Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Infection prevention and control	10.1002/ped4.12186	Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei province, China	('China', 26)
Clinical Characteristics of Children with Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Hubei, China	Zheng, F.; Liao, C.; Fan, Q. H.; Chen, H. B.; Zhao, X. G.; Xie, Z. G.; Li, X. L.; Chen, C. X.; Lu, X. X.; Liu, Z. S.; Lu, W.; Chen, C. B.; Jiao, R.; Zhang, A. M.; Wang, J. T.; Ding, X. W.; Zeng, Y. G.; Cheng, L. P.; Huang, Q. F.; Wu, J.; Luo, X. C.; Wang, Z. J.; Zhong, Y. Y.; Bai, Y.; Wu, X. Y.; Jin, R. M.	Since December 2019, COVID-19 has occurred unexpectedly and emerged as a health problem worldwide. Despite the rapidly increasing number of cases in subsequent weeks, the clinical characteristics of pediatric cases are rarely described. A cross-sectional multicenter study was carried out in 10 hospitals across Hubei province. A total of 25 confirmed pediatric cases of COVID-19 were collected. The demographic data, epidemiological history, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological data, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. Of 25 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the boy to girl ratio was 1.27:1. The median age was 3 years. COVID-19 cases in children aged <3 years, 3.6 years, and >/=6-years patients were 10 (40%), 6 (24%), and 9 (36%), respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (13 [52%]), and dry cough (11 [44%]). Chest CT images showed essential normal in 8 cases (33.3%), unilateral involvement of lungs in 5 cases (20.8%), and bilateral involvement in 11 cases (45.8%). Clinical diagnoses included upper respiratory tract infection (n=8), mild pneumonia (n=15), and critical cases (n=2). Two critical cases (8%) were given invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin. The symptoms in 24 (96%) of 25 patients were alleviated and one patient had been discharged. It was concluded that children were susceptible to COVID-19 like adults, while the clinical presentations and outcomes were more favorable in children. However, children less than 3 years old accounted for majority cases and critical cases lied in this age group, which demanded extra attentions during home caring and hospitalization treatment.	2020	NA	Current medical science	NA	NA	NA	32207032	10.1007/s11596-020-2172-6	15190	#13587	Zheng 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s11596-020-2172-6	Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China|Department of Pediatrics, Yichang No. 3 People‚Äôs Hospital, Yichang, 443000, China|Department of Pediatrics, Jingzhou First People‚Äôs Hospital, Jingzhou, 434000, China|Department of Pediatrics, Yichang Central Hospital, Yichang, 443000, China|Department of Pediatrics, Xiangyang First People‚Äôs Hospital, Xiangyang, 441000, China|Department of Pediatrics, Shiyan People‚Äôs Hospital, Shiyan, 442000, China|Department of Pediatrics, Huanggang Central Hospital, Huanggang, 438000, China|Department of Pediatrics, Jiangling People‚Äôs Hospital, Jingzhou, 434101, China|Department of Pediatrics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Hospital, Wuhan, 430074, China	('China', 9)
Risk Stratification and PPE Use in Pediatric Endoscopy During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Single-Center Protocol	Say, Daphne S.; de Lorimier, Arthur; Lammers, Cathleen R.; Natale, JoAnne; Lakshminrusimha, Satyan; Wiedeman, Jean; Partridge, Elizabeth	SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is now a global pandemic. Human-to-human transmission has been documented to occur through respiratory secretions, feces, aerosols, and contaminated environmental surfaces. Pediatric patients present a unique challenge as they may have minimal symptoms and yet transmit disease. Endoscopists face risk for infection with viruses like SARS-CoV-2, as the aerosol generating nature of endoscopy diffuses respiratory disease that can be spread via an airborne and droplet route. We describe our center's methodology for pediatric patient risk stratification to facilitate responsible use of endoscopic resources during this crisis. We also describe our recommendations for use of personal protective equipment by endoscopists, with the goal of ensuring the safety of ourselves, our anesthesiology and endoscopy staff, and our patients.

Potential benefits of precise corticosteroids therapy for severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia	Gao, Wei Zhou; Yisi, Liu; Dongdong, Tian; Cheng, Wang; Sa, Wang; Jing, Cheng; Ming, Hu; Minghao, Fang; Yue	Salvage corticosteroids treatment for critical patients with 2019-nCoV? Corticosteroids are widely used to prevent lung injury caused by severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP) due to their excellent pharmacological effects on the suppression of exuberant and dysfunctional systematic inflammation5. Some scholars may not support the corticosteroids treatment for novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), because observational studies and systematic reviews have indicated inconclusive clinical evidence on the effect of corticosteroids therapy for viral pneumonias (such as SARS, MERS and H1N1). Additionally, pulse-dose therapy or long-term administration to high dose of corticosteroids in early stage were reported to be possibly harmful6,7,8. However, these conclusions obscured the clinical benefits of corticosteroids on some subgroups of patients, particularly those with severe symptoms, as the clinical effects might be related to the indication (severities of illness), the timing of intervention, the dose and duration of corticosteroids therapy9.	2020	NA	Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy	5	1	3-Jan	NA	10.1038/s41392-020-0127-9	276	#1644	Gao 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1038/s41392-020-0127-9	Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, 100850, Beijing, P.

Coronavirus outbreaks: prevention and management recommendationsAB - What role can pharmacists play? The International Pharmaceutical Federation is emphasizing the active role of community and hospital pharmacists can play in preventing the spread of COVID-19 [17]. Pharmacists are often a reliable and first point of contact for individuals having concerns or needing information and advice regarding ailments. Moreover, pharmacists are readily available at community pharmacies and hospital and accessible to the general population. Essential responsibilities of pharmacists include: having appropriate medicinal products in stock; promoting proper handwashing to prevent disease; controlling in-hospital infection; and providing patient care and support. Pharmacists also play a crucial role in the prevention, early detection of certain types of new cases and referring suspected cases to the relevant healthcare authorities [17].JO - Drugs & Therapy Perspectives	Khan, Zakir; Muhammad, Khayal; Ahmed, Ali; Rahman, Hazir	NA	2020	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s40267-020-00717-x	5773	#4768	Khan 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1007/s40267-020-00717-x	Department of Pharmacology (Pharmacovigilance), Institute of Health Sciences, Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey|Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan|Department of Pharmacy, Comsat University (Abbottabad Campus), Abbottabad, Pakistan|Department of Microbiology, Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan (AWKUM), Mardan, Pakistan	('Pakistan', 3)|('uk', 1)|('Turkey', 1)
Important Steps to Control COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 Infection	Chatterjee, Sudipto	Elderly patients are having high mortality rates from COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to younger patients. The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses theÂ ACE2 receptor as the entry point to the host cells. ARBs/ACEIs which are widely used in elderly patients, haveÂ been found to beÂ associated with overexpression of ACE2.To decrease the severity of COVID-19 infection, ARB/ACEI should be switched to another class drug not known to cause a rise in ACE2 until the COVID-19 infection subsides. Specific human immunoglobulin can be tried for COVID-19 patients with critical conditions under supervision.	2020	NA	SN Comprehensive Clinical Medicine	NA	NA	2-Jan	NA	10.1007/s42399-020-00271-7	45216	#42029	Chatterjee 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s42399-020-00271-7	Department of Pharmacology, Kempegowda Institute of Medical Science, Bangalore, Karnataka, 560070, India	('India', 1)

Genomic variance of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus	Ceraolo, Carmine; Giorgi, Federico M.	There is a rising global concern for the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Full genomic sequences have been released by the worldwide scientific community in the last few weeks to understand the evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. Taking advantage of all the genomic information currently available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including also representatives of other coronaviridae, such as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome. We confirm high sequence similarity (>99%) between all sequenced 2019-nCoVs genomes available, with the closest BCoV sequence sharing 96.2% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV. Despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019-nCoV genomes, we could identify at least two hypervariable genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8-encoded protein. Finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae, identifying key aminoacidic differences to be considered for antiviral strategies deriving from previous anti-coronavirus approaches.	2020	NA	Journal of Medical Virology	92	5	522-528	WOS:000517439500001	10.1002/jmv.25700	10692	#10412	Ceraolo 2020	NA	Other related diseases and viruses	10.1002/jmv.25700	Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy|Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy|Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy|Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy	('Italy', 4)

Restructuring the Inpatient Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience to Reduce the Risk of Contracting COVID-19: Lessons from Saudi Arabia	Badreldin, Hisham A.; Alshaya, Omar; Saleh, Khalid Bin; Alshaya, Abdulrahman I.	Abstract On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the rapidly spreading epidemic of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Almost all countries started to take proactive precautionary measures to reduce the risk of contracting the virus. The education sector, including pharmacy education, has been drastically impacted by this pandemic. During the outbreak, many hospitals instructed the health profession's schools to restrict or prevent the presence of their students and interns in their hospitals in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. Constraining the presence of interns in the affiliated hospital has impacted the integrity of delivering the learning outcomes of each clinical rotation. In this paper, we present the experience of four faculty preceptors in restructuring the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience in different clinical settings, including critical care, infectious diseases, cardiology, and internal medicine, in order to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 at a large academic medical institution in Saudi Arabia. We believe that this experience could provide guidance and insights for other pharmacy schools dealing with this issue during this global pandemic. This article is protected by copyright.

Natural products and their derivatives against coronavirus: A review of the non-clinical and pre-clinical data	Islam, Muhammad Torequl; Sarkar, Chandan; El-Kersh, Dina M.; Jamaddar, Sarmin; Uddin, Shaikh Jamal; Shilpi, Jamil A.; Mubarak, Mohammad S.	Several corona viral infections have created serious threats in the last couple of decades claiming the death of thousands of human beings. Recently, corona viral epidemic raised the issue of developing effective antiviral agents at the earliest to prevent further losses. Natural products have always played a crucial role in drug development process against various diseases which resulted in screening of such agents to combat emergent mutants of corona virus. This review focuses on those natural compounds that showed promising results against corona viruses. Although inhibition of viral replication is often considered as a general mechanism for antiviral activity of most of the natural products, studies have shown that some natural products can interact with key viral proteins that are associated with virulence. In this context, some of the natural products have antiviral activity in the nanomolar concentration (e.g., lycorine, homoharringtonine, silvestrol, ouabain, tylophorine and 7-methoxycryptopleurine), and could be leads for further drug development on their own or as a template for drug design. In addition, a good number of natural products with anti-corona virus activity are the major constituents of some common dietary supplements which can be exploited to improve the immunity of the general population in certain epidemics.

Is Pakistan prepared to tackle the coronavirus epidemic?	Saqlain, Muhammad; Munir, Muhammad Muddasir; Ahmed, Ali; Tahir, Azhar Hussain; Kamran, Sohail	The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the coronavirus epidemic as a global public health emergency of international concern [1]. On 11 February 2020, the virus was named by the WHO as â€˜severe acute respiratory tract coronavirus-2â€™ (SARS-CoV-2; also referred to as 2019-nCOV), and the disease it causes as â€˜COVID-19â€™ [1]. On 26 February 2020, for the first time, the number of new cases outside China was higher than the number of new cases inside China (427 vs. 411 new cases) [2]. By 11 March 2020, the virus had spread to 113 countries and territories, with the number of registered cases reaching 118,162 and the number of deaths reaching 4290 (mortality rate 3.63%) [3]. The WHO states that the COVID-19 outbreak is now categorized as a pandemic, with the number of cases increasing by 13-fold in 2 weeks [4], and has issued alerts to countries at risk of getting COVID-19 [5]. Also on 26 February 2020, the Pakistan Federal Health Minister confirmed the first two cases of COVID-19 in Karachi and Islamabad [2, 6]. Within 15 days (12 March), the total number of positive COVID-19 tests reached 20, with 14 cases in Sindh Province, 5 in Gilgit Baltistan and 1 in a 12-year-old child in Baluchistan) [7]. All cases had a history of a recent visit to Iran, Syria or London. To 12 March 2020, a total of 471 suspected samples had been tested, 20 (4.25%) of which were found to be positive [7]. Pakistan borders countries infected with COVID-19, including China, an epicenter of the disease that currently has the highest number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 (nâ€‰=â€‰3162), to the north, and Iran, a country with the third highest number of COVID-19-associated mortalities (nâ€‰=â€‰291), to the west; Italy has the second highest number of deaths [3]. This geographical location, as well as a continual increase in the number of confirmed cases, demands a high level of preparedness and requires actions to be taken promptly before the situation becomes worse [8]. The WHO states that countries should take steps to prevent and limit further spread of the virus, including active surveillance, early detection, quarantine, clinical management, and tracing of close contacts [5].	2020	NA	Drugs & Therapy Perspectives	NA	NA	2-Jan	NA	10.1007/s40267-020-00721-1	12323	#11233	Saqlain 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Epidemiology	10.1007/s40267-020-00721-1	Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-I-Azam University, Islamabad, 45320, Pakistan|Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan	('Pakistan', 2)

Tocilizumab treatment in COVID-19: a single center experience	Luo, Pan; Liu, Yi; Qiu, Lin; Liu, Xiulan; Liu, Dong; Li, Juan	Abstract Background Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6 (IL-6), emerged as an alternative treatment for COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms recently. In the present study, we aimed to discuss the treatment response of TCZ therapy in COVID-19 infected patients. Methods The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 before and after TCZ therapy, and clinical outcome in the 15 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively assessed. Results Totally 15 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. 2 of them were moderately ill, 6 were seriously ill and 7 were critically ill. The TCZ was used in combination with methylprednisolone (MP) in 8 patients. 5 patients received the TCZ administration twice or more. Although TCZ treatment ameliorated the increased CRP in all patients rapidly, for the 4 critically ill patients who received only single dose of TCZ, 3 of them (No. 1, 2, and 3) still dead and the CRP level in the rest 1 patient (No. 7) failed to return to normal range with a clinical outcome of disease aggravation. Serum IL-6 level tended to further spiked firstly and then decreased after TCZ therapy in 10 patients. A persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 was observed in these 4 patients who failed treatment. Conclusion TCZ appears to be an effective treatment option in COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms. And for these critically ill patients with elevated IL-6, repeated dose of the TCZ is recommended. This article is protected by copyright.

Prehabilitation could save lives in a pandemic	Silver, Julie K.	Letâ€™s use best practice prehabilitation to improve patientsâ€™ health before the upcoming â€œbattleâ€ Prehabilitation involves interventions aimed at improving patientsâ€™ health before an anticipated upcoming physiologic stressor so that they are better able to withstand that stress. Prehabilitation emerged as a way to prepare soldiers for battle in the second world war. A study published in 1946 in The BMJ , entitled Prehabilitation, Rehabilitation, and Revocation in the Army, described an experiment in which â€œgood food, lodging, hygiene, and recreation combined with controlled physical training and educationâ€ for a period of around two months was found to improve the health ratings of 85% of the 12â€‰000 men who participated. The report stated that the participantsâ€™ outlook on life also improved, and that these physical and psychological changes were â€œastonishingly easyâ€ to accomplish. Modern day military training continues to use similar interventions. Although the covid-19 pandemic is not a literal war, many people will have to â€œfightâ€ a future infection, and what science has taught us since that study was published could be vital to helping affected patients â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	369	NA	m1386-m1386	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1386	34256	#34837	Silver 2020	NA	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1386	Department of Physical Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care Medicine	('USA', 1)

Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics comparison with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV	Meo, S. A.; Alhowikan, A. M.; Al-Khlaiwi, T.; Meo, I. M.; Halepoto, D. M.; Iqbal, M.; Usmani, A. M.; Hajjar, W.; Ahmed, N.	OBJECTIVE: Human infections with zoonotic coronavirus contain emerging and reemerging pathogenic characteristics which have raised great public health concern. This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data on the global outbreak of "2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV" were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the information from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. RESULTS: Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916 (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27 states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April 2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020. The fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The major clinical manifestations in coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea, confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia. Global health authorities should take immediate measures to prevent the outbreaks of such emerging and reemerging pathogens across the globe to minimize the disease burden locally and globally.	2020	NA	European review for medical and pharmacological sciences	24	4	2012-2019	32141570	10.26355/eurrev_202002_20379	5592	#4906	Meo 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.26355/eurrev_202002_20379	Department of Physiology, Strategic Centre for Diabetes Research, Thoracic Surgery, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. sultanmeo@hotmail.com	('Saudi Arabia', 1)

Understanding of COVID-19 based on current evidence	Sun, Pengfei; Lu, Xiaosheng; Xu, Chao; Sun, Wenjuan; Pan, Bo	Since December 2019, a series of unexplained pneumonia cases has been reported in Wuhan, China. On January 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) temporarily named this new virus as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). On February 11, 2020, the WHO officially named the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV as Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19). The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading all over the world, especially in China. Based on the published evidence, we systematically discuss the characteristics of COVID-19 in the hope of providing a reference for future studies and help for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.

Clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: A single arm meta-analysis	Sun, P.; Qie, S.; Liu, Z.; Ren, J.; Li, K.; Xi, J.	OBJECTIVE: We aim to summarize reliable evidence of evidence-based medicine for the treatment and prevention of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by analyzing all the published studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched. Several studies on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Meta-analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 0.891 (95% CI: 0.818, 0.945), the incidence of cough was 0.722 (95% CI: 0.657, 0.782), and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 0.425 (95% CI: 0.213, 0.652). The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 0.148 (95% CI: 0.046, 0.296), the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 0.966 (95% CI: 0.921, 0.993), the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 0.181 (95% CI: 0.127, 0.243), and the case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.043 (95% CI: 0.027, 0.061). CONCLUSION: Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and most of these patients have abnormal chest CT examination. Several people have muscle soreness or fatigue as well as ARDS. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms are rare. The case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This meta-analysis also has limitations, so the conclusions of this Meta-analysis still need to be verified by more relevant studies with more careful design, more rigorous execution, and larger sample size.	2020	NA	Journal of medical virology	NA	NA	NA	32108351	10.1002/jmv.25735	13817	#13087	Sun 2020	NA	* Systematic review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1002/jmv.25735	Department of Plastic Surgery, Zibo Central Hospital, Zibo, China|Department of Rehabilitation, Beijing Rehabilitation Hospital of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China|Department of Rehabilitation, Beijing Rehabilitation Hospital of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China|Department of Plastic Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China|Department of Plastic Surgery, Qingdao Eighth People's Hospital, Qingdao, China|Department of Respiratory Rehabilitation, Beijing Rehabilitation Hospital of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China|Department of Plastic Surgery, Zibo Central Hospital, Zibo, China|Department of Rehabilitation, Beijing Rehabilitation Hospital of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China|Department of Rehabilitation, Beijing Rehabilitation Hospital of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China|Department of Plastic Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China|Department of Plastic Surgery, Qingdao Eighth People's Hospital, Qingdao, China|Department of Respiratory Rehabilitation, Beijing Rehabilitation Hospital of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China	('China', 12)

SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are primarily expressed in bronchial transient secretory cells	Lukassen, Soeren; Lorenz Chua, Robert; Trefzer, Timo; Kahn, Nicolas C.; Schneider, Marc A.; Muley, Thomas; Winter, Hauke; Meister, Michael; Veith, Carmen; Boots, Agnes W.; Hennig, Bianca P.; Kreuter, Michael; Conrad, Christian; Eils, Roland	Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affecting the human respiratory system severely challenges public health and urgently demands for increasing our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, especially host factors facilitating virus infection and replication. SARS-CoV-2 was reported to enter cells via binding to ACE2, followed by its priming by TMPRSS2. Here, we investigate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels and their distribution across cell types in lung tissue (twelve donors, 39,778 cells) and in cells derived from subsegmental bronchial branches (four donors, 17,521 cells) by single nuclei and single cell RNA sequencing, respectively. While TMPRSS2 is expressed in both tissues, in the subsegmental bronchial branches ACE2 is predominantly expressed in a transient secretory cell type. Interestingly, these transiently differentiating cells show an enrichment for pathways related to RHO GTPase function and viral processes suggesting increased vulnerability for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data provide a rich resource for future investigations of COVID-19 infection and pathogenesis.	2020	NA	The EMBO Journal	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.15252/embj.20105114	31019	#31105	Lukassen 2020	NA	NA	10.15252/embj.20105114	Department of Pneumology and Respiratory Critical Care Medicine, Center for interstitial and rare lung diseases, Thoraxklinik, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany|Department of Thoracic Surgery, Thoraxklinik, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany|Department of Pneumology and Respiratory Critical Care Medicine, Center for interstitial and rare lung diseases, Thoraxklinik, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany|Department of Pneumology and Respiratory Critical Care Medicine, Center for interstitial and rare lung diseases, Thoraxklinik, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany|Department of Thoracic Surgery, Thoraxklinik, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany|Department of Pneumology and Respiratory Critical Care Medicine, Center for interstitial and rare lung diseases, Thoraxklinik, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany|Department of Pneumology and Respiratory Critical Care Medicine, Center for interstitial and rare lung diseases, Thoraxklinik, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany|Department of Thoracic Surgery, Thoraxklinik, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany	('Germany', 8)

Assessment of Health Information About COVID-19 Prevention on the Internet: Infodemiological Study	Hernandez-Garcia, Ignacio; Gimenez-Julvez, Teresa	BACKGROUND: The internet is a large source of health information and has the capacity to influence its users. However, the information found on the internet often lacks scientific rigor, as anyone may upload content. This factor is a cause of great concern to scientific societies, governments, and users. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the information about the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the internet. METHODS: On February 29, 2020, we performed a Google search with the terms "Prevention coronavirus," "Prevention COVID-19," "Prevencion coronavirus," and "Prevencion COVID-19". A univariate analysis was performed to study the association between the type of authorship, country of publication, and recommendations to avoid COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: In total, 80 weblinks were reviewed. Most of them were produced in the United States and Spain (n=58, 73%) by digital media sources and official public health organizations (n=60, 75%). The most mentioned WHO preventive measure was "wash your hands frequently" (n=65, 81%). A less frequent recommendation was to "stay home if you feel unwell" (n=26, 33%). The analysis by type of author (official public health organizations versus digital media) revealed significant differences regarding the recommendation to wear a mask when you are healthy only if caring for a person with suspected COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 4.39). According to the country of publication (Spain versus the United States), significant differences were detected regarding some recommendations such as "wash your hands frequently" (OR 9.82), "cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze" (OR 4.59), or "stay home if you feel unwell" (OR 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to urge and promote the use of the websites of official public health organizations when seeking information on COVID-19 preventive measures on the internet. In this way, users will be able to obtain high-quality information more frequently, and such websites may improve their accessibility and positioning, given that search engines justify the positioning of links obtained in a search based on the frequency of access to them.	2020	NA	JMIR Public Health Surveill	NA	NA	NA	32217507	10.2196/18717	42785	#40244	Hernandez-Garcia 2020	NA	NA	10.2196/18717	Department of Preventive Medicine, Lozano Blesa University Clinical Hospital of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain|Department of Preventive Medicine, Miguel Servet University Hospital of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain|Department of Preventive Medicine	('Spain', 2)

Covid-19: a remote assessment in primary care	Greenhalgh, Trisha; Koh, Gerald Choon Huat; Car, Josip	### What you need to know A 37 year-old healthcare assistant develops a cough. Next day, she wakes with a fever (which she measures at 37.4Â°C) and shortness of breath. She manages her condition at home for several days, experiencing increasing tiredness, loss of appetite, and a persistent dry cough. On the fifth day of her illness, she develops mild diarrhoea, and her chest feels quite tight. She takes her temperature, which has gone up to 38.1Â°C. Feeling unwell, she contacts her GP surgery for advice. She would like someone to listen to her chest, but the receptionist tells her not to come to the surgery and offers her the choice of a telephone or video consultation. She was previously well apart from mild asthma (on occasional salbutamol). Five years ago, she took citalopram for anxiety. She is a single parent of three children. Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is an urgent and spreading threat whose clinical and epidemiological characteristics are still being documented.12 With a view to containing covid-19, a shift from in-person to remote consulting is occurring. Clinicians are thus faced with a new disease and a new way of interacting with patients. This article will present some guiding principles on how to choose between telephone and video appointments, how to conduct a â€œquery covidâ€ consultation remotely, and considerations when arranging follow-up and next steps.

Health services provision of 48 public tertiary dental hospitals during the COVID-19 epidemic in China	Yang, Yang; Zhou, Yin; Liu, Xiaoqiang; Tan, Jianguo	To assess the status of health services provision of public tertiary dental hospitals during the COVID-19 epidemic in China and to evaluate the regional difference of telehealth. The health services provision of public tertiary dental hospitals in China mainland during the COVID-19 epidemic was inquired. The status of non-emergency dental services, emergency dental services, and online professional consultation and the hospitalsâ€™ geographical distribution were recorded and analyzed. All the 48 public tertiary dental hospitals suspended general non-emergency dental treatment while providing emergency dental services only. Ninety percent of them notified the change of dental services online, and 69% of them offered free online professional consultations. The penetration rate of online technology was significantly higher in the eastern region than that of the central and western regions. There was a significant change in the health service provision of Chinese public tertiary dental hospitals during the COVID-19 epidemic and wider use of telehealth in the eastern region. This report demonstrated that dental health services were significantly affected by the COVID-19 epidemic in China, which might lead to a long-time impact on dental care in the future.	2020	NA	Clinical Oral Investigations	NA	NA	4-Jan	NA	10.1007/s00784-020-03267-8	30955	#30727	Yang 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s00784-020-03267-8	Department of Prosthodontics, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology & Beijing Key Laboratory of Digital Stomatology, 22 Zhongguancun Avenue South, Haidian District, Beijing, 100081, People‚Äôs Republic of China|Department of Anesthesiology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034, People‚Äôs Republic of China	('China', 2)
Dealing with sleep problems during home confinement due to the COVID-19 outbreak: practical recommendations from a task force of the European CBT-I Academy	Altena, Ellemarije; Baglioni, Chiara; Espie, Colin A.; Ellis, Jason; Gavriloff, Dimitri; Holzinger, Brigitte; Schlarb, Angelika; Frase, Lukas; JernelÃ¶v, Susanna; Riemann, Dieter	Abstract In the current global home confinement situation due to the COVID-19 outbreak, most individuals are exposed to an unprecedented stressful situation of unknown duration. This may not only increase daytime stress, anxiety and depression levels but also disrupt sleep. Importantly, because of the fundamental role that sleep plays in emotion regulation, sleep disturbance can have direct consequences upon next day emotional functioning. In this paper we summarize what is known about the stress-sleep link and confinement as well as effective insomnia treatment. We discuss those effects of the current home confinement situation that can disrupt sleep but also those that could benefit sleep quality. We suggest adaptions of cognitive behavioral therapy elements that are feasible to implement for those facing changed work schedules and requirements, those with health anxiety and those handling childcare and homeschooling, whilst also recognizing the general limitations imposed on physical exercise and social interaction. Managing sleep problems as best as possible during home confinement can limit stress and possibly prevent disruptions of social relationships.	2020	NA	Journal of Sleep Research	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/jsr.13052	31042	#31210	Altena 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/jsr.13052	Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Faculty of Medicine, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany|Department of Human Sciences, University of Rome ‚ÄòG.

Conducting Clinical Research During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Investigator and Participant Perspectives	Padala, Prasad R.; Jendro, Ashlyn M.; Padala, Kalpana P.	As the medical landscape changes daily with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, clinical researchers are caught off-guard and are forced to make decisions on research visits in their ongoing clinical trials. Although there is some guidance from local and national organizations, the principal investigator (PI) is ultimately responsible for determining the risk-benefit ratio of conducting, rescheduling, or cancelling each research visit. The PI should take into consideration the ethical principles of research, local/national guidance, the community risk of the pandemic in their locale, staffing strain, and the risk involved to each participant, to ultimately decide on the course of action. While balancing the rights and protection of the human subject, we seldom examine patients' views and opinions about their scheduled research visit(s). This article discusses the ethical principles of beneficence and autonomy in helping the decision-making process. We discuss ways to weigh-in local and national guidance, staffing strain, and institutional support into the decision-making process and outline potential changes needed for regulatory bodies depending on the decision. Further, we discuss the need to weigh-in the individual risk-benefit ratio for each participant and present a decision tree to navigate this complex process. Finally, we examine participant and caregiver perspectives on their fears, sense of preparedness, and factors that they consider before deciding whether to keep or postpone the research appointments. This entry also provides PIs ways to support their research participants in both scenarios, including provision of psychological support.	2020	NA	JMIR public health and surveillance	6	2	e18887-e18887	NA	10.2196/18887	37844	#38763	Padala 2020	NA	NA	10.2196/18887	Department of Psychiatry, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, United States|Department of Geriatrics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, United States	('United States', 2)

Transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak and effectiveness of government interventions: A data-driven analysis	Fang, Y.; Nie, Y.; Penny, M.	Using the parameterized SEIR model, we simulated the spread dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak and impact of different control measures, conducted the sensitivity analysis to identify the key factor, plotted the trend curve of effective reproductive number(R) and performed data fitting after the simulation. By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the data fitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with slower increase of the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for sars-cov-2 led to the upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals and comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.

2019 novel Coronavirus outbreak: a quiz or final exam?	Xu, J.; Chen, Y.; Chen, H.; Cao, B.	The 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen and is threatening the global health. Strikingly, more than 28 000 cases and 550 deaths have been reported within two months from disease emergence. Armed with experience from previous epidemics in the last two decades, clinicians, scientists, officials, and citizens in China are all contributing to the prevention of further 2019-nCoV transmission. Efficient preliminary work has enabled us to understand the basic characteristics of 2019-nCoV, but there are still many unanswered questions. It is too early now to judge our performance in this outbreak. Continuous and strengthened efforts should be made not only during the epidemic, but also afterwards in order to prepare for any incoming challenges.	2020	NA	Frontiers of medicine	NA	NA	NA	32198708	10.1007/s11684-020-0753-1	12236	#11146	Xu 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Ethics, social science, economics	10.1007/s11684-020-0753-1	Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Center for Respiratory Medicine, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, 100029, China|Institute of Respiratory Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100005, China	('China', 3)|('Japan', 1)

P.; Hu, Y.; Cheng, Z. S.; Liu, L. L.; Qian, Z. H.; Qin, C.; Jin, Q.; Cao, B.; Wang, J. W.	BACKGROUND: Human infections with zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, have raised great public health concern globally. Here, we report a novel bat-origin CoV causing severe and fatal pneumonia in humans. METHODS: We collected clinical data and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from Jin Yin-tan Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Nucleic acids of the BAL were extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing. Virus isolation was carried out, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed. RESULTS: Five patients hospitalized from December 18 to December 29, 2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation. One of these patients died. Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown beta-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8-99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates. These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843). The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6-87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade. Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs. However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor. CONCLUSION: A novel bat-borne CoV was identified that is associated with severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans.	2020	NA	Chinese medical journal	NA	NA	NA	32004165	10.1097/cm9.0000000000000722	246	#122	Ren 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Virology, immunology	10.1097/cm9.0000000000000722	Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Center of Respiratory Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseases, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing 100029, China|Institute of Respiratory Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100029, China|Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing 100029, China|Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China|Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Tsinghua University School of Medicine, Beijing, 100084, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Sciences and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430014, China|Department of Respiratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430071, China.

Recommendations for respiratory rehabilitation in adults with COVID-19	Zhao, Hong-Mei; Xie, Yu-Xiao; Wang, Chen	Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious respiratory disease that leads to respiratory, physical, and psychological dysfunction in patients. Respiratory rehabilitation is an important intervention as well as cure for clinical patients. With increased understanding of COVID-19 and the accumulation of clinical experience, we proposed recommendations for respiratory rehabilitation in adults with COVID-19 based on the opinions of frontline clinical experts involved in the management of this epidemic and a review of the relevant literature and evidence. Our recommendations are as follows: 1. for inpatients with COVID-19, respiratory rehabilitation would relieve the symptoms of dyspnea, anxiety, and depression and eventually improve physical functions and the quality of life; 2. for severe/critical inpatients, early respiratory rehabilitation is not suggested; 3. for patients in isolation, respiratory rehabilitation guidance should be conducted through educational videos, instruction manuals, or remote consultation; 4. assessment and monitoring should be performed throughout the respiratory rehabilitation process; 5. proper grade protection should be used following the present guidelines. These recommendations can guide clinical practice and form the basis for respiratory rehabilitation in COVID-19 patients.	2020	NA	Chin Med J (Engl)	NA	NA	NA	32251002	10.1097/CM9.0000000000000848	41570	#41696	Zhao 2020	NA	NA	10.1097/CM9.0000000000000848	Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China-Japan Friendship Hospital; Institute of Respiratory Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences; National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseases, Beijing 100029, China|Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing 100029, China	('China', 4)|('Japan', 2)
Development and Clinical Application of A Rapid IgM-IgG Combined Antibody Test for SARS-CoV-2 Infection Diagnosis	Li, Zhengtu; Yi, Yongxiang; Luo, Xiaomei; Xiong, Nian; Liu, Yang; Li, Shaoqiang; Sun, Ruilin; Wang, Yanqun; Hu, Bicheng; Chen, Wei; Zhang, Yongchen; Wang, Jing; Huang, Baofu; Lin, Ye; Yang, Jiasheng; Cai, Wensheng; Wang, Xuefeng; Cheng, Jing; Chen, Zhiqiang; Sun, Kangjun; Pan, Weimin; Zhan, Zhifei; Chen, Liyan; Ye, Feng	Abstract The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quickly spread all over China and to more than 20 other countries. Although the virus (SARS-Cov-2) nucleic acid RT-PCR test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8 different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test.

Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still the source of considerable uncertainly. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in the city Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Up to 25th of January 2020, at least 1,975 cases have been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on the 12th of December 2019. Epidemiological investigation suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. We studied one patient who was a worker at the market, and who was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital on 26th of December 2019 experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome including fever, dizziness and cough. Metagenomic RNA sequencing(4) of a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample identified a novel RNA virus from the family Coronaviridae, designed here as WH-Human-1 coronavirus. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) previously sampled from bats in China. This outbreak highlights the ongoing capacity of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.	2020	NA	Nature	NA	NA	10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3	32015508	10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3	594	#258	Wu 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Awaiting classification; Virology, immunology	10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3	Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Zoonosis, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China	('China', 3)
Clinical characteristics of Non-ICU hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and liver injuryï¼šA Retrospective study	Xie, Hansheng; Zhao, Jianming; Lian, Ningfang; Lin, Su; Xie, Qunfang; Zhuo, Huichang	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised world concern for global epidemic since December, 2019. Limited data are available for liver function in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to investigate the risk factors related to liver injury in the COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in Non-ICU Ward at Jinyintan Hospital from February 2, 2020 to February 23, 2020. Consecutively confirmed COVID-19 discharged cases were enrolled. The clinical characteristics of patients with liver injury and without liver injury were compared. RESULTS: A total of 79 COVID-19 patients were included. 31.6%, 35.4% and 5.1% COVID-19 patients had elevated levels of ALT, AST and bilirubin, respectively. Median value of ALT, AST and bilirubin for entire cohort were 36.5 (17.5~71.5) U/L, 34.5 (25.3~ 55.3) U/L and 12.7 (8.1~15.4) mmol/L, respectively. There were no significant differences in age, previous medical history, and symptoms between the two groups. Males were more likely to have liver injury when infected with COVID-19 (p<0.05); Compared to patients without liver injury, patients with liver injury had increased levels of white blood cell counts, neutrophils, CRP and CT score (p< 0.05), and had a longer length of stay (p< 0.05). Logistic regression analyses suggested that the extent of pulmonary lesions on CT was a predictor of liver function damage (p< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Liver injury is common in Non-ICU hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It may be related to systemic inflammation. Intense monitoring and evaluation of liver function in patients with severe pulmonary imaging lesions should be considered.	2020	NA	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/liv.14449	26562	#27347	Xie 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/liv.14449	Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China	('China', 10)

2019 novel coronavirus of pneumonia in Wuhan, China: emerging attack and management strategies	She, Jun; Jiang, Jinjun; Ye, Ling; Hu, Lijuan; Bai, Chunxue; Song, Yuanlin	An ongoing outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China at the end of 2019. With the spread of the new coronavirus accelerating, person-to-person transmission in family homes or hospitals, and intercity spread of 2019-nCoV occurred. At least 40,261 cases confirmed, 23,589 cases suspected, 909 cases death and 3444 cases cured in China and worldwide 24 countries confirmed 383 cases being diagnosed, 1 case death in February 10th, 2020. At present, the mortality of 2019-nCoV in China is 2.3%, compared with 9.6% of SARS and 34.4% of MERS reported by WHO. It seems the new virus is not as fatal as many people thought. Chinese authorities improved surveillance network, made the laboratory be able to recognize the outbreak within a few weeks and announced the virus genome that provide efficient epidemiological control. More comprehensive information is required to understand 2019-nCoV feature, the epidemiology of origin and spreading, and the clinical phenomina. According to the current status, blocking transmission, isolation, protection, and alternative medication are the urgent management strategies against 2019-nCoV.	2020	NA	Clin Transl Med	9	1	19-19	32078069	10.1186/s40169-020-00271-z	150	#1493	She 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology	10.1186/s40169-020-00271-z	Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 180 Feng Lin Road, Shanghai, 200032, China	('China', 1)

Radiology Perspective of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Lessons From Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome	Hosseiny, M.; Kooraki, S.; Gholamrezanezhad, A.; Reddy, S.; Myers, L.	OBJECTIVE. Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pulmonary illness coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, more than 79,000 people have contracted the virus worldwide. The virus is rapidly spreading with human-to-human transmission despite imposed precautions. Because similar pulmonary syndromes have been reported from other strains of the coronavirus family, our aim is to review the lessons from imaging studies obtained during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks. CONCLUSION. The review of experiences with the MERS and SARS outbreaks will help us better understand the role of the radiologist in combating the outbreak of COVID-19. The known imaging manifestations of the novel coronavirus and the possible unknowns will also be discussed.	2020	NA	AJR.

The high fatality of aged cases caused by SARS-CoV-2 was a need to explore the possible age-related phenomena with non-human primate models. Methods Three 3-5Â years old and two 15Â years old rhesus macaques were intratracheally infected with SARS-CoV-2, and then analyzed by clinical signs, viral replication, chest X-ray, histopathological changes and immune response. Results Viral replication of nasopharyngeal swabs, anal swabs and lung in old monkeys was more active than that in young monkeys for 14Â days after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Monkeys developed typical interstitial pneumonia characterized by thickened alveolar septum accompanied with inflammation and edema, notably, old monkeys exhibited diffuse severe interstitial pneumonia. Viral antigens were detected mainly in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 caused more severe interstitial pneumonia in old monkeys than that in young monkeys. Rhesus macaque models infected with SARS-CoV-2 provided insight into the pathogenic mechanism and facilitated the development of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 infection.	2020	NA	Animal Models and Experimental Medicine	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/ame2.12108	21117	#20861	Yu 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/ame2.12108	Department of Radiology, Bejing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China|Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China|Department of Radiology, Bejing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China|Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China	('China', 4)
Mediastinal Emphysema, Giant Bulla, and Pneumothorax Developed during the Course of COVID-19 Pneumonia	Sun, R.; Liu, H.; Wang, X.	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is a recent outbreak in mainland China and has rapidly spread to multiple countries worldwide. Pulmonary parenchymal opacities are often observed during chest radiography. Currently, few cases have reported the complications of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. We report a case where serial follow-up chest computed tomography revealed progression of pulmonary lesions into confluent bilateral consolidation with lower lung predominance, thereby confirming COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, complications such as mediastinal emphysema, giant bulla, and pneumothorax were also observed during the course of the disease.	2020	NA	Korean journal of radiology	NA	NA	NA	32207255	10.3348/kjr.2020.0180	15187	#13685	Sun 2020	NA	* Case study/series	10.3348/kjr.2020.0180	Department of Radiology, Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.

Chest CT Findings in Patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019 and its Relationship with Clinical Features	Wu, Jiong; Wu, Xiaojia; Zeng, Wenbing; Guo, Dajing; Fang, Zheng; Chen, Linli; Huang, Huizhe; Li, Chuanming	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the chest computed tomography (CT) findings in patients with confirmed corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate its relationship with clinical features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study sample consisted of 80 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 from January to February 2020. The chest CT images and clinical data were reviewed and the relationship between them was analyzed. RESULTS: Totally 80 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. With regards to the clinical manifestations, 58/80 (73%) of patients had cough, 61/80 (76%) of patients had high temperature levels. The most frequent CT abnormalities observed were ground glass opacity (GGO) (73/80 cases, 91%), consolidation (50/80 cases, 63%) and interlobular septal thickening (47/80, 59%). Most of the lesions were multiple, with an average of 12Â±6 lung segments involved. The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (69/80, 86%), the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (68/80, 85%), the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (64/80, 80%), the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe (61/80, 76%) and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe (65/80, 81%). The average pulmonary inflammation index (PII) value was (34%Â±20%) for all the patients. Correlation analysis showed that the PII value was significantly correlated with the values of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, days from illness onset and body temperature (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The common chest CT findings of COVID-19 are multiple GGO, consolidation and interlobular septal thickening in both lungs, which are mostly distributed under the pleura. There are significant correlations between the degree of pulmonary inflammation and the main clinical symptoms and laboratory results. CT plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of this emerging global health emergency.	2020	NA	Invest Radiol	NA	NA	10.1097/RLI.0000000000000670	32091414	10.1097/RLI.0000000000000670	1148	#1744	Wu 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1097/RLI.0000000000000670	Department of Radiology, Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital|Department of Radiology	NA
CT imaging changes of corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19): a multi-center study in Southwest China	Li, Xiaoming; Zeng, Wenbing; Li, Xiang; Chen, Haonan; Shi, Linping; Li, Xinghui; Xiang, Hongnian; Cao, Yang; Chen, Hui; Liu, Chen; Wang, Jian	Since the first case of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Southwest China. The aim of this study was to describe the imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in southwest China. In this retrospective study, data were collected from 131 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from 3 Chinese hospitals. Their common clinical manifestations, as well as characteristics and evolvement features of chest CT images, were analyzed. A total of 100 (76%) patients had a history of close contact with people living in Wuhan, Hubei. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 included cough, fever. Most of the lesions identified in chest CT images were multiple lesions of bilateral lungs, lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung, 109 (83%) patients had more than two lobes involved, 20 (15%) patients presented with patchy ground glass opacities, patchy ground glass opacities and consolidation of lesions co-existing in 61 (47%) cases. Complications such as pleural thickening, hydrothorax, pericardial effusion, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were detected but only in rare cases. For the follow-up chest CT examinations (91 cases), We found 66 (73%) cases changed very quickly, with an average of 3.5Â days, 25 cases (27%) presented absorbed lesions, progression was observed in 41 cases (46%), 25 (27%) cases showed no significant changes. Chest CT plays an important role in diagnosing COVID-19. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed consolidation is highly suspicious of COVID-19, that can quickly change over a short period of time.	2020	NA	Journal of Translational Medicine	18	1	154-154	NA	10.1186/s12967-020-02324-w	34248	#34901	Li 2020	NA	NA	10.1186/s12967-020-02324-w	Department of Radiology, First Affiliated Hospital to Army Medical University, Chongqing, China|Department of Radiology, Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China|Department of Radiology, Hubei Provincial Corps Hospital Chinese People‚Äôs Armed Police Forces, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Radiology, Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, Sichuan, China|Department of Radiology, Chongqing Wuxi County People‚Äôs Hospital, Chongqing, China|Department of Radiology, Dianjiang¬†People‚Äôs¬†Hospital¬†of¬† Chongqing, Chongqing, China	('China', 6)

Ultra-high-resolution computed tomography can demonstrate alveolar collapse in novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia	Iwasawa, Tae; Sato, Midori; Yamaya, Takafumi; Sato, Yozo; Uchida, Yoshinori; Kitamura, Hideya; Hagiwara, Eri; Komatsu, Shigeru; Utsunomiya, Daisuke; Ogura, Takashi	PURPOSE: To review the chest computed tomography (CT) findings on the ultra-high-resolution CT (U-HRCT) in patients with the Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In February 2020, six consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (median age, 69Â years) underwent U-HR CT imaging. U-HR-CT has a larger matrix size of 1024â€‰Ã—â€‰1024 thinner slice thickness of 0.25Â mm and can demonstrate terminal bronchioles in the normal lungs; as a result, Reid's secondary lobules and their abnormalities can be identified. The distribution and hallmarks (ground-glass opacity, consolidation with or without architectural distortion, linear opacity, crazy paving) of the lung opacities on U-HRCT were visually evaluated on a 1Â K monitor by two experienced reviewers. The CT lung volume was measured, and the ratio of the measured lung volume to the predicted total lung capacity (predTLC) based on sex, age and height was calculated. RESULTS: All cases showed crazy paving pattern in U-HRCT. In these lesions, the secondary lobules were smaller than those in the un-affected lungs. CT lung volume decreased in two cases comparing predTLC. CONCLUSION: U-HRCT can evaluate not only the distribution and hallmarks of COVID-19 pneumonia but also visualize local lung volume loss.	2020	NA	Japanese journal of radiology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s11604-020-00956-y	26593	#27270	Iwasawa 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s11604-020-00956-y	Department of Radiology, Kanagawa Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center, 6-16-1, Tomioka-higashi, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama, 236-0051, Japan|Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kanagawa Cardiovascular & Respiratory Centerr, Yokohama, Japan	('Japan', 2)
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Systematic Review of Imaging Findings in 919 Patients	Salehi, Sana; Abedi, Aidin; Balakrishnan, Sudheer; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali	OBJECTIVE. Available information on CT features of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is scattered in different publications, and a cohesive literature review has yet to be compiled. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This article includes a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), Google Scholar, and the World Health Organization database. RESULTS. Known features of COVID-19 on initial CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification (GGO) with a peripheral or posterior distribution, mainly in the lower lobes and less frequently within the right middle lobe. Atypical initial imaging presentation of consolidative opacities superimposed on GGO may be found in a smaller number of cases, mainly in the elderly population. Septal thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, and subpleural involvement are some of the less common findings, mainly in the later stages of the disease. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, lymphadenopathy, cavitation, CT halo sign, and pneumothorax are uncommon but may be seen with disease progression. Follow-up CT in the intermediate stage of disease shows an increase in the number and size of GGOs and progressive transformation of GGO into multifocal consolidative opacities, septal thickening, and development of a crazy paving pattern, with the greatest severity of CT findings visible around day 10 after the symptom onset. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the most common indication for transferring patients with COVID-19 to the ICU and the major cause of death in this patient population. Imaging patterns corresponding to clinical improvement usually occur after week 2 of the disease and include gradual resolution of consolidative opacities and decrease in the number of lesions and involved lobes. CONCLUSION. This systematic review of current literature on COVID-19 provides insight into the initial and follow-up CT characteristics of the disease.	2020	NA	AJR.

Clinical Features and Chest CT Manifestations of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Single-Center Study in Shanghai, China	Cheng, Zenghui; Lu, Yong; Cao, Qiqi; Qin, Le; Pan, Zilai; Yan, Fuhua; Yang, Wenjie	OBJECTIVE. Confronting the new coronavirus infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging and requires excluding patients with suspected COVID-19 who actually have other diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical features and CT manifestations of COVID-19 by comparing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia who presented at a fever observation department in Shanghai, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS. Eleven patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results. No statistical difference in clinical features was observed (p > 0.05), with the exception of leukocyte and platelet counts (p < 0.05). The mean (Â± SD) interval between onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation department was 4.40 Â± 2.00 and 5.52 Â± 4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test results, respectively. The frequency of opacifications in patients with positive results and patients with negative results, respectively, was as follows: ground-glass opacities (GGOs), 100.0% versus 90.9%; mixed GGO, 63.6% versus 72.7%; and consolidation, 54.5% versus 77.3%. In patients with positive RT-PCR results, GGOs were the most commonly observed opacification (seen in 100.0% of patients) and were predominantly located in the peripheral zone (100.0% of patients), compared with patients with negative results (31.8%) (p = 0.05). The median number of affected lung lobes and segments was higher in patients with positive RT-PCR results than in those with negative RT-PCR results (five vs 3.5 affected lobes and 15 vs nine affected segments; p < 0.05). Although the air bronchogram reticular pattern was more frequently seen in patients with positive results, centrilobular nodules were less frequently seen in patients with positive results. CONCLUSION. At the point during the COVID-19 outbreak when this study was performed, imaging patterns of multifocal, peripheral, pure GGO, mixed GGO, or consolidation with slight predominance in the lower lung and findings of more extensive GGO than consolidation on chest CT scans obtained during the first week of illness were considered findings highly suspicious of COVID-19.	2020	NA	AJR.

Computed Tomography Manifestations of 5 Cases of the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia From Patients Outside Wuhan	Lu, T.; Pu, H.	Clinical, laboratory, and computed tomography (CT) findings of 5 cases of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia from patients outside of Wuhan were reviewed. The human-to-human transmission of the virus may explain the infection of the disease outside of Wuhan. CT examination is important in the early detection and follow-up of the disease. With a history of exposure or travelling, symptoms of fever and cough, and the typical CT manifestation such as ground-glass opacity with a peripheral distribution, we should also think of the possibility of the COVID-19 pneumonia in patients outside of Wuhan.	2020	NA	Journal of thoracic imaging	NA	NA	NA	32195887	10.1097/rti.0000000000000508	11666	#11337	Lu 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1097/rti.0000000000000508	Department of Radiology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People‚Äôs Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan, China	('China', 1)

High-Resolution Computed Tomography Manifestations of 5 Pediatric Patients With 2019 Novel Coronavirus	Liu, Mengqi; Song, Zongbiao; Xiao, Kaihu	We present clinical and chest computed tomography (CT) features of 5 cases of pediatric patients with 2019 novel coronavirus. Two patients had fever and dry cough, whereas the rest of 3 patients were asymptomatic. Three patients had unilateral ground glass opacities with or without consolidation in the subpleural region on high-resolution chest CT, 1 patient had bilateral ground glass opacities, and 1 patient was negative for CT. We note that up to 66.7% asymptomatic patients had pulmonary lesions, so the asymptomatic children with Wuhan contact are recommended to do a 2019 novel coronavirus real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction screening. Unlike adult patients, only a small amount of patients had multilobes affected, so we speculate that the pediatric patients generally have milder CT findings than adults.

CT image of novel coronavirus pneumonia: a case report	Zhang, Xiangmin; Song, Wei; Liu, Xingli; Lyu, Liang	OBJECTIVE: Knowledge of CT characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia might be helpful to the early diagnosis and treatment of patients, and to control the spread of infection. METHODS: The chest CT images of the patient were collected to describe the CT manifestations and characteristics, and they were compared with the previous studies. RESULTS: Multiple patchy ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were seen in bilateral lung, mostly in subpleural areas. They progressed within 3Â days, and nodular GGOs were also seen together with subpleural patchy GGOs. CONCLUSION: Our case of COVID-19 pneumonia showed multiple subpleural GGOs in bilateral lung, rapid progression, and it also accompanied nodular GGOs on chest CT. These findings were consistent with the previous reports, and they might be useful for early detection and evaluation of severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.	2020	NA	Japanese journal of radiology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s11604-020-00945-1	10243	#10180	Zhang 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s11604-020-00945-1	Department of Radiology, The First People‚Äôs Hospital of Yunnan Province, No. 157 Jinbi Road, Kunming, 650032, Yunnan, China	('China', 1)

Coronavirus disease 2019: initial chest CT findings	Zhou, Zhiming; Guo, Dajing; Li, Chuanming; Fang, Zheng; Chen, Linli; Yang, Ran; Li, Xiang; Zeng, Wenbing	OBJECTIVES: To systematically analyze CT findings during the early and progressive stages of natural course of coronavirus disease 2019 and also to explore possible changes in pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities during these two stages. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the initial chest CT data of 62 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients (34 men, 28 women; age range 20-91Â years old) who did not receive any antiviral treatment between January 21 and February 4, 2020, in Chongqing, China. Patients were assigned to the early-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4Â days) or progressive-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4-7Â days) for analysis. CT characteristics and the distribution, size, and CT score of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were assessed. RESULTS: In our study, the major characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019 was ground-glass opacity (61.3%), followed by ground-glass opacity with consolidation (35.5%), rounded opacities (25.8%), a crazy-paving pattern (25.8%), and an air bronchogram (22.6%). No patient presented cavitation, a reticular pattern, or bronchial wall thickening. The CT scores of the progressive-stage group were significantly greater than those of the early-stage group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Multiple ground-glass opacities with consolidations in the periphery of the lungs were the primary CT characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019. CT score can be used to evaluate the severity of the disease. If these typical alterations are found, then the differential diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 must be considered. KEY POINTS: â€¢ Multiple GGOs with consolidations in the periphery of the lungs were the primary CT characteristic of COVID-19. â€¢ The halo sign may be a special CT feature in the early-stage COVID-19 patients. â€¢ Significantly increased CT score may indicate the aggravation of COVID-19 in the progressive stage.	2020	NA	European radiology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s00330-020-06816-7	16665	#15825	Zhou 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s00330-020-06816-7	Department of Radiology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China|Department of Radiology, Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, 404000, China|Institutional Review Board approval was obtained.

The Clinical and Chest CT Features Associated with Severe and Critical COVID-19 Pneumonia	Li, Kunhua; Wu, Jiong; Wu, Faqi; Guo, Dajing; Chen, Linli; Fang, Zheng; Li, Chuanming	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and CT features associated with severe and critical Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including 25 severe/critical cases and 58 ordinary cases were enrolled. The chest CT images and clinical data of them were reviewed and compared. The risk factors associated with disease severity were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with the ordinary patients, the severe/critical patients had older ages, higher incidence of comorbidities, cough, expectoration, chest pain and dyspnea. The incidences of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern and bronchial wall thickening in severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients. Besides, severe/critical patients showed higher incidences of lymph node enlargement, pericardial effusion and pleural effusion than the ordinary patients. The CT scores of severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients (P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the sensitivity and specificity of CT Score were 80.0% and 82.8% respectively for the discrimination of the two types. The clinical factors of age > 50 years old, comorbidities, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, expectoration, decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation indicators were risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. CT findings of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, bronchial wall thickening, high CT scores and extrapulmonary lesions were features of severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations and CT manifestations between the ordinary patients and the severe/critical patients. Many factors are related to the severity of the disease, which can help clinicians to judge the severity of the patient and evaluate the prognosis.	2020	NA	Invest Radiol	NA	NA	10.1097/RLI.0000000000000672	32118615	10.1097/RLI.0000000000000672	2646	#3060	Li 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1097/RLI.0000000000000672	Department of Radiology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China|Department of Radiology, Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China|Department of Medical Service, Yanzhuang Central Hospital of Gangcheng District, Jinan, China	('China', 3)
Relation Between Chest CT Findings and Clinical Conditions of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pneumonia: A Multicenter Study	Zhao, Wei; Zhong, Zheng; Xie, Xingzhi; Yu, Qizhi; Liu, Jun	OBJECTIVE. The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. Lesions are more likely to have peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal. CT involvement score can help in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease.	2020	NA	AJR Am J Roentgenol	NA	NA	6-Jan	32125873	10.2214/AJR.20.22976	3063	#3238	Zhao 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.2214/AJR.20.22976	Department of Radiology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, No. 139 Middle Remin Rd, Changsha, Hunan, 410011, P.R.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Role of Chest CT in Diagnosis and Management	Li, Yan; Xia, Liming	OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate of radiologists for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. The CT features of COVID-19 are reported and compared with the CT features of other viruses to familiarize radiologists with possible CT patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This study included the first 51 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing (23 women and 28 men; age range, 26-83 years) and two patients with adenovirus (one woman and one man; ages, 58 and 66 years). We reviewed the clinical information, CT images, and corresponding image reports of these 53 patients. The CT images included images from 99 chest CT examinations, including initial and follow-up CT studies. We compared the image reports of the initial CT study with the laboratory test results and identified CT patterns suggestive of viral infection. RESULTS. COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection at the initial CT study in two inpatients with underlying disease and COVID-19. Viral pneumonia was correctly diagnosed at the initial CT study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two patients with adenovirus. These patients were isolated and obtained treatment. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with or without vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT features of COVID-19. The The "reversed halo" sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign are uncommon CT features. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of adenovirus infection. There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. CONCLUSION. We found that chest CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and may be useful as a standard method for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to optimize the management of patients. However, CT is still limited for identifying specific viruses and distinguishing between viruses.	2020	NA	AJR Am J Roentgenol	NA	NA	7-Jan	32130038	10.2214/AJR.20.22954	4641	#4517	Li 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.2214/AJR.20.22954	Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China.

CT Features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia in 62 Patients in Wuhan, China	Zhou, S.; Wang, Y.; Zhu, T.; Xia, L.	OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate 62 subjects in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and describe the CT features of this epidemic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective study of 62 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was performed. CT images and clinical data were reviewed. Two thoracic radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT signs of the lesions and also scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square test was used to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [+/- SD] age, 52.8 +/- 12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who had their erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18 (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. Multiple lesions were seen on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions. The mean CT score for the upper zone (3.0 +/- 3.4) was significantly lower than that for the middle (4.5 +/- 3.8) and lower (4.5 +/- 3.7) zones (p = 0.022 and p = 0.020, respectively), and there was no significant difference in the mean CT score of the middle and lower zones (p = 1.00). The mean CT score for the anterior area (4.4 +/- 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 +/- 6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients (40.3%) had ground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%), microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a subpleural line; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms of pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (</= 7 days after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic streaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease. CONCLUSION. CT examination of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a mixed and diverse pattern with both lung parenchyma and the interstitium involved. Identification of GGO and a single lesion on the initial CT scan suggested early-phase disease. CT signs of aggravation and repair coexisted in advanced-phase disease. Lesions presented with a characteristic multifocal distribution in the middle and lower lung regions and in the posterior lung area. A decreased lymphocyte count and an increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level were the most common laboratory findings.	2020	NA	AJR.

A Comparative Study of Chest Computed Tomography Features in Young and Older Adults With Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19)	Zhu, Tingting; Wang, Yujin; Zhou, Shuchang; Zhang, Na; Xia, Liming	OBJECTIVE: To analyze the most common computed tomography (CT) findings of pneumonia caused by new coronavirus in younger patients (60 and younger) and older adults (older than 60). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chest CT images of 72 symptomatic patients with corona virus disease (COVID-19) were analyzed retrospectively, including 44 younger patients (47.5Â±8.7â€‰y old) and 28 older patients (68.4Â±6.0â€‰y old). CT findings including density (pure ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with consolidation, consolidation), the number of lobes involved, lesion distribution, and the main accompanying signs were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Characteristic CT findings included the lobes of bilateral lung extensively involved, ground-glass opacity and ground-glass opacity with consolidation in the peripheral area, sometimes accompanied by interlobular septal thickening, and subpleural line and pleural thickening. Compared with the younger group, the proportion of extensive involvement of lung lobes was higher in the elderly group (71.4% vs. 36.4%, P=0.009), and subpleural line and pleural thickening were more likely to occur (50.0% vs. 25.0%, and 71.4% vs. 40.9%, P=0.030 and 0.011, respectively). CONCLUSION: Elderly and younger patients with corona virus disease have some common CT features, but older patients are more likely to have extensive lung lobe involvement, and subpleural line and pleural thickening. These differentiated characteristics may be related to the progress and prognosis of the disease.	2020	NA	Journal of thoracic imaging	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1097/RTI.0000000000000513	26568	#27107	Zhu 2020	NA	NA	10.1097/RTI.0000000000000513	Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan	NA

Pregnancy and Perinatal Outcomes of Women With Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pneumonia: A Preliminary Analysis	Liu, Dehan; Li, Lin; Wu, Xin; Zheng, Dandan; Wang, Jiazheng; Yang, Lian; Zheng, Chuansheng	OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations and CT features of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in 15 pregnant women and to provide some initial evidence that can be used for guiding treatment of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the clinical data and CT examinations of 15 consecutive pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020. A semiquantitative CT scoring system was used to estimate pulmonary involvement and the time course of changes on chest CT. Symptoms and laboratory results were analyzed, treatment experiences were summarized, and clinical outcomes were tracked. RESULTS. Eleven patients had successful delivery (10 cesarean deliveries and one vaginal delivery) during the study period, and four patients were still pregnant (three in the second trimester and one in the third trimester) at the end of the study period. No cases of neonatal asphyxia, neonatal death, stillbirth, or abortion were reported. The most common early finding on chest CT was ground-glass opacity (GGO). With disease progression, crazy paving pattern and consolidations were seen on CT. The abnormalities showed absorptive changes at the end of the study period for all patients. The most common onset symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were fever (13/15 patients) and cough (9/15 patients). The most common abnormal laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia (12/15 patients). CT images obtained before and after delivery showed no signs of pneumonia aggravation after delivery. The four patients who were still pregnant at the end of the study period were not treated with antiviral drugs but had achieved good recovery. CONCLUSION. Pregnancy and childbirth did not aggravate the course of symptoms or CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia. All the cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in the pregnant women in our study were the mild type. All the women in this study-some of whom did not receive antiviral drugs-achieved good recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia.	2020	NA	AJR.

Chest CT manifestations of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a pictorial review	Ye, Zheng; Zhang, Yun; Wang, Yi; Huang, Zixiang; Song, Bin	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, first reported in Wuhan, China, has rapidly swept around the world just within a month, causing global public health emergency. In diagnosis, chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations can supplement parts of limitations of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Based on a comprehensive literature review and the experience in the frontline, we aim to review the typical and relatively atypical CT manifestations with representative COVID-19 cases at our hospital, and hope to strengthen the recognition of these features with radiologists and help them make a quick and accurate diagnosis. Key Points â€¢ Ground glass opacities, consolidation, reticular pattern, and crazy paving pattern are typical CT manifestations of COVID-19. â€¢ Emerging atypical CT manifestations, including airway changes, pleural changes, fibrosis, nodules, etc., were demonstrated in COVID-19 patients. â€¢ CT manifestations may associate with the progression and prognosis of COVID-19.	2020	NA	European Radiology	NA	NA	9-Jan	NA	10.1007/s00330-020-06801-0	10275	#10207	Ye 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s00330-020-06801-0	Department of Radiology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No. 37 Guoxue Alley, Wuhou District, Chengdu, 610041, China|Institutional Review Board approval was obtained.

Early Clinical and CT Manifestations of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia	Han, Rui; Huang, Lu; Jiang, Hong; Dong, Jin; Peng, Hongfen; Zhang, Dongyou	OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate early clinical and CT manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were enrolled in this retrospective study. The clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and CT findings were evaluated. RESULTS. One hundred eight patients (38 men, 70 women; age range, 21-90 years) were included in the study. The clinical manifestations were fever in 94 of 108 (87%) patients, dry cough in 65 (60%), and fatigue in 42 (39%). The laboratory results were normal WBC count in 97 (90%) patients and normal or reduced lymphocyte count in 65 (60%). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was elevated in 107 (99%) patients. The distribution of involved lobes was one lobe in 38 (35%) patients, two or three lobes in 24 (22%), and four or five lobes in 46 (43%). The major involvement was peripheral (97 patients [90%]), and the common lesion shape was patchy (93 patients [86%]). Sixty-five (60%) patients had ground-glass opacity (GGO), and 44 (41%) had GGO with consolidation. The size of lesions varied from smaller than 1 cm (10 patients [9%]) to larger than 3 cm (56 patients [52%]). Vascular thickening (86 patients [80%]), crazy paving pattern (43 patients [40%]), air bronchogram sign (52 patients [48%]), and halo sign (69 [64%]) were also observed in this study. CONCLUSION. The early clinical and laboratory findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are low to midgrade fever, dry cough, and fatigue with normal WBC count, reduced lymphocyte count, and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. The early CT findings are patchy GGO with or without consolidation involving multiple lobes, mainly in the peripheral zone, accompanied by halo sign, vascular thickening, crazy paving pattern, or air bronchogram sign.	2020	NA	AJR.

Timely Diagnosis and Treatment Shortens the Time to Resolution of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pneumonia and Lowers the Highest and Last CT Scores From Sequential Chest CT	Huang, Guoquan; Gong, Tao; Wang, Guangbin; Wang, Jianwen; Guo, Xinfu; Cai, Erpeng; Li, Shirong; Li, Xiaohu; Yu, Yongqiang; Lin, Liangjie	OBJECTIVE. This study aims to assess correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution and CT scores as based on findings from sequential chest CT examinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Thirty patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis underwent chest CT examinations. Five patients who did not have positive CT findings or who had not yet fulfilled criteria for discharge from the hospital were excluded. CT scores were determined according to CT findings and lung involvement. The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment was recorded for each patient, and on the basis of this information, patients with COVID-19 were divided into group 1 (patients for whom this interval was â‰¤ 3 days) and group 2 (those for whom this interval was > 3 days). The CT scores for each group were fitted using a Lorentzian line-shape curve to show the variation tendency during treatment. The differences in age, sex, and last CT scores determined before discharge between the two groups were analyzed, and correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution as well as with the highest CT score also underwent statistical analysis. RESULTS. A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in the study. The fitted tendency curves for group 1 and group 2 were significantly different, with peak points showing that the estimated highest CT score was 10 and 16 for each group, respectively, and the time to disease resolution was 6 and 13 days, respectively. The Mann-Whitney test showed that the last CT scores were lower for group 1 than for group 2 (p = 0.025), although the chi-square test found no difference in age and sex between the groups. The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment had a positive correlation with the time to disease resolution (r = 0.93; p = 0.000) as well as with the highest CT score (r = 0.83; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION. Timely diagnosis and treatment are key to providing a better prognosis for patients with COVID-19.	2020	NA	AJR.

A case report of COVID-19 with false negative RT-PCR test: necessity of chest CT	Feng, Hao; Liu, Yujian; Lv, Minli; Zhong, Jianquan	The definite diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is based on the viral isolation or positive result of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from sputum, or nasal swab, or throat swab. However, the sensitivity to detect COVID-19 of real time (RT)-PCR is reported to be lower than that of chest CT. We report a case of 34-year-old man who was diagnosed as negative for COVID-19 based on the four sequential RT-PCR tests of his pharyngeal swab. Chest CT showed patchy ground-glass opacity on admission, and it rapidly progressed to segmental mixed consolidation and ground-glass opacity 3Â days after admission, and it resolved in left upper lobe, but showed multifocal ground-glass opacities 7Â days after admission, and they resolved within 2Â weeks. The fifth RT-PCR test finally revealed positive results at the fifth day after admission. It is difficult to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other viral pneumonia on CT findings alone; however, we emphasize the utility of chest CT to detect early change of COVID-19 in cases which RT-PCR tests show negative results.	2020	NA	Japanese Journal of Radiology	NA	NA	2-Jan	NA	10.1007/s11604-020-00967-9	34419	#34990	Feng 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s11604-020-00967-9	Department of Radiology, Zigong First People‚Äôs Hospital, Zigong, 643000, People‚Äôs Republic of China	('China', 1)

The Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Development and Initial Validation	Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi; Lin, Chung-Ying; Imani, Vida; Saffari, Mohsen; Griffiths, Mark D.; Pakpour, Amir H.	Background: The emergence of the COVID-19 and its consequences has led to fears, worries, and anxiety among individuals worldwide. The present study developed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to complement the clinical efforts in preventing the spread and treating of COVID-19 cases. Methods: The sample comprised 717 Iranian participants. The items of the FCV-19S were constructed based on extensive review of existing scales on fears, expert evaluations, and participant interviews. Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain its reliability and validity properties. Results: After panel review and corrected item-total correlation testing, seven items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.47 to 0.56) were retained and further confirmed by significant and strong factor loadings (0.66 to 0.74). Also, other properties evaluated using both classical test theory and Rasch model were satisfactory on the seven-item scale. More specifically, reliability values such as internal consistency (alpha = .82) and test-retest reliability (ICC = .72) were acceptable. Concurrent validity was supported by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (with depression, r = 0.425 and anxiety, r = 0.511) and the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (with perceived infectability, r = 0.483 and germ aversion, r = 0.459). Conclusion: The Fear of COVID-19 Scale, a seven-item scale, has robust psychometric properties. It is reliable and valid in assessing fear of COVID-19 among the general population and will also be useful in allaying COVID-19 fears among individuals.	2020	NA	Int J Ment Health Addict	NA	NA	NA	32226353	10.1007/s11469-020-00270-8	26946	#25251	Ahorsu 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s11469-020-00270-8	Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong|Department of Nursing, School of Health and Welfare, J√∂nk√∂ping University, J√∂nk√∂ping, Sweden	('Sweden', 1)
Nursing and the Novel Coronavirus: Risks and Responsibilities in a Global Outbreak	Choi, Kristen R.; Skrine Jeffers, Kia; Logsdon, M. Cynthia	Abstract In December of 2019, reports emerged of pneumonia clusters of unknown cause at health facilities in Wuhan, China. These cases were linked to a wet animal wholesale market in the region and, after extensive epidemiologic investigation, led to identification of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). COVID-19 is among a family of viruses?called coronaviruses?that can affect both humans and animals (Zhu et al., 2020).	2020	NA	Journal of Advanced Nursing	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/jan.14369	12534	#11645	Choi 2020	NA	* Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Infection prevention and control	10.1111/jan.14369	Department of Research & Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, CA, USA|Department of Research & Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, CA, USA	('USA', 2)
The potential chemical structure of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase	Lung, Jrhau; Lin, Yu-Shih; Yang, Yao-Hsu; Chou, Yu-Lun; Shu, Li-Hsin; Cheng, Yu-Ching; Liu, Hung Te; Wu, Ching-Yuan	An outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan and it has rapidly spread to almost all parts of the world. For coronaviruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important protease that catalyze the replication of RNA from RNA template and is an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we screened these chemical structures from traditional Chinese medicinal compounds proven to show anti-viral activity in SARS-CoV and the similar chemical structures through a molecular docking study to target RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We found that theaflavin has a lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of RdRp in SARS-CoV-2 (-9.11 kcal/mol), SARS-CoV (-8.03 kcal/mol) and MERS-CoV (-8.26 kcal/mol) from idock. To confirm the result, we discovered that theaflavin has a lower binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol when it docks in the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by using the Blind Docking server. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were found between theaflavin and RdRp. Moreover, one Ï€-cation interaction was formed between theaflavin and Arg553 from the Blind Docking server. Our results suggest that theaflavin could be potential SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor for further study. This article is protected by copyright.

Fecal specimen diagnosis 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia	Zhang, JingCheng; Wang, SaiBin; Xue, YaDong	The emergence and spread of 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia (COVID-19) from Wuhan, China, it has spread globally. We extracted the data on 14 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinhua Municipal Central hospital through January 27th, 2020. We found that compared to pharyngeal swab specimens, nucleic acid detection of COVID-19 in fecal specimens was equally accurate. And we found that patients with a positive stool test did not experience gastrointestinal symptoms and had nothing to do with the severity of the lung infection. These results may help to understand the clinical diagnosis and the changes of clinical parameters of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a clinical update	Zhou, Min; Zhang, Xinxin; Qu, Jieming	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed a significant threat to global health. It caused a total of 80 868 confirmed cases and 3101 deaths in Chinese mainland until March 8, 2020. This novel virus spread mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact. As disease progressed, a series of complications tend to develop, especially in critically ill patients. Pathological findings showed representative features of acute respiratory distress syndrome and involvement of multiple organs. Apart from supportive care, no specific treatment has been established for COVID-19. The efficacy of some promising antivirals, convalescent plasma transfusion, and tocilizumab needs to be investigated by ongoing clinical trials.	2020	NA	Frontiers of Medicine	NA	NA	10-Jan	NA	10.1007/s11684-020-0767-8	30961	#30879	Zhou 2020	NA	NA	10.1007/s11684-020-0767-8	Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China|Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China	('China', 2)

In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 Ã— 10(9)/L vs. 0.76 Ã— 10(9)/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.	2020	NA	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1073/pnas.2004168117	37800	#38297	Duan 2020	NA	NA	10.1073/pnas.2004168117	Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, |Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, |Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, |Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, |Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, |Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, |Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, |Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, 	NA
Analysis of factors associated with disease outcomes in hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease	Liu, Wei; Tao, Zhao-Wu; Lei, Wang; Ming-Li, Yuan; Kui, Liu; Ling, Zhou; Shuang, Wei; Yan, Deng; Jing, Liu; Liu, Hui-Guo; Ming, Yang; Yi, Hu	BACKGROUND: Since early December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. This study aims to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, Uâ€Š=â€Š4.932, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, Ï‡â€Š=â€Š9.291, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]Â°C, Uâ€Š=â€Š2.057, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5% vs. 20.9%, Ï‡â€Š=â€Š5.611, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, Uâ€Š=â€Š4.030, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, Uâ€Š=â€Š1.315, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62â€ŠÂ±â€Š6.60 vs. 41.27â€ŠÂ±â€Š4.55â€Šg/L, Uâ€Š=â€Š2.843, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (Ï‡â€Š=â€Š16.01, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628-44.864; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577-25.000; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95% CI: 1.036-78.147, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95% CI: 1.942-40.000; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI: 1.098-50.000; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI: 1.224-34.701, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.028) were risk factors for disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature on admission, respiratory failure, albumin, C-reactive protein. These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.	2020	NA	Chin Med J (Engl)	NA	NA	10.1097/CM9.0000000000000775	32118640	10.1097/CM9.0000000000000775	3128	#3344	Liu 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Infection prevention and control	10.1097/CM9.0000000000000775	Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430014, China|Department of Respiratory Intensive Care Unit, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430014, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China|Department of Radiology, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China	('China', 4)

The experience of high-flow nasal cannula in hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in two hospitals of Chongqing, China	Wang, Ke; Zhao, Wei; Li, Ji; Shu, Weiwei; Duan, Jun	BACKGROUND: The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) is currently ongoing in China. Most of the critically ill patients received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy. However, the experience of HFNC in this population is lacking. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 318 confirmed patients with NCIP in two hospitals of Chongqing, China, from January 1st to March 4th, 2020. Among them, 27 (8.4%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure including 17 patients (63%) treated with HFNC as first-line therapy, 9 patients (33%) treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and one patient (4%) treated with invasive ventilation. HFNC failure was defined by the need of NIV or intubation as rescue therapy. RESULTS: Of the 17 HFNC patients, 7 (41%) experienced HFNC failure. The HFNC failure rate was 0% (0/6) in patients with PaO2/FiO2 > 200 mm Hg vs. 63% (7/11) in those with PaO2/FiO2 </= 200 mm Hg (p = 0.04). Compared with baseline data, the respiratory rate significantly decreased after 1-2 h of HFNC in successful group [median 26 (IQR: 25-29) vs. 23 (22-25), p = 0.03]. However, it did not in the unsuccessful group. After initiation of NIV as rescue therapy among the 7 patients with HFNC failure, PaO2/FiO2 significantly improved after 1-2 h of NIV [median 172 (150-208) mmHg vs. 114 (IQR: 79-130) under HFNC, p = 0.04]. However, two out of seven (29%) patients with NIV as rescue therapy ultimately received intubation. Among the 27 patients with severe acute respiratory failure, four patients were eventually intubated (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that HFNC was the most common ventilation support for patients with NCIP. Patients with lower PaO2/FiO2 were more likely to experience HFNC failure.	2020	NA	Ann Intensive Care	NA	NA	NA	32232685	10.1186/s13613-020-00653-z	27190	#30076	Wang 2020	NA	NA	10.1186/s13613-020-00653-z	Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400010, People‚Äôs Republic of China|Department of Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400010, People‚Äôs Republic of China|Department of Thoracic Surgery, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, 500106, People‚Äôs Republic of China|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Yongchuan Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Xuanhua Road 429, Yongchuan District, Chongqing, 402160, People‚Äôs Republic of China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Youyi Road 1, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400016, People‚Äôs Republic of China	('China', 5)
Novel coronavirus infection in children outside of Wuhan, China	Shen, Qinxue; Guo, Wei; Guo, Ting; Li, Jinhua; He, Wenlong; Ni, Shanshan; Ouyang, Xiaoli; Liu, Jiyang; Xie, Yuanlin; Tan, Xin; Zhou, Zhiguo; Peng, Hong	BACKGROUND: Since December 8, 2019, an epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly, but information about children with COVID-19 is limited. METHODS: This retrospective and the single-center study were done at the Public Health Clinic Center of Changsha, Hunan, China. We identified all hospitalized children diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 8, 2019 and February 19, 2020, in Changsha. Epidemiological and clinical data of these children were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed until February 26th, 2020. RESULTS: By February 19, 2020, nine pediatric patients were identified as having 2019-nCoV infection in Changsha. Six children had a family exposure and could provide the exact dates of close contact with someone who was confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection, among whom the median incubation period was 7.5 days. The initial symptoms of the nine children were mild, including fever (3/9), diarrhea (2/9), cough (1/9), and sore throat (1/9), two had no symptoms. Two of the enrolled patients showed small ground-glass opacity of chest computed tomography scan. As of February 26, six patients had a negative RT-PCR for 2019-nCoV and were discharged. The median time from exposure to a negative RT-PCR was 14 days. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of the new coronavirus infection in children were not typical and showed a less aggressive clinical course than teenage and adult patients. Children who have a familial clustering or have a family member with a definite diagnosis should be reported to ensure a timely diagnosis.	2020	NA	Pediatric pulmonology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1002/ppul.24762	37872	#38305	Shen 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/ppul.24762	Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital of Changsha, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Infectious Disease, The First Hospital of Changsha, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Hospital of Changsha, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital of Changsha, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital of Changsha, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Infectious Disease, The First Hospital of Changsha, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Pediatrics, the First Hospital of Changsha, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital of Changsha, Changsha, Hunan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central‚ÄêSouth University, Changsha, Hunan, China	('China', 24)
Understanding SARS-CoV-2-Mediated Inflammatory Responses: From Mechanisms to Potential Therapeutic Tools	Fu, Yajing; Cheng, Yuanxiong; Wu, Yuntao	Currently there is no effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which frequently leads to fatal inflammatory responses and acute lung injury. Here, we discuss the various mechanisms of SARS-CoV-mediated inflammation. We also assume that SARS-CoV-2 likely shares similar inflammatory responses. Potential therapeutic tools to reduce SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory responses include various methods to block FcR activation. In the absence of a proven clinical FcR blocker, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin to block FcR activation may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent severe lung injury. Such treatment may also be combined with systemic anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. However, these strategies, as proposed here, remain to be clinically tested for effectiveness.	2020	NA	Virol Sin	NA	NA	10.1007/s12250-020-00207-4	32125642	10.1007/s12250-020-00207-4	3064	#3407	Fu 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Virology, immunology	10.1007/s12250-020-00207-4	Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510275, China	('China', 1)
Clinical characteristics of fatal and recovered cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China: a retrospective study	Deng, Yan; Liu, Wei; Liu, Kui; Fang, Yuan-Yuan; Shang, Jin; zhou, Ling; Wang, Ke; Leng, Fan; Wei, Shuang; Chen, Lei; Liu, Hui-Guo	Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused the outbreak of the acute respiratory disease in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China since December 2019. This study is performed to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients who succumbed to and who recovered from 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Methods: Clinical data were collected from two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan. A retrospective investigation was conducted to analyze the clinical characteristics of fatal cases of COVID-19 (death group) and compare them with recovered patients (recovered group). Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed by Ï‡2 test or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate. Results: Our study enrolled 109 COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization and 116 recovered patients. The median age of the death group was older than the recovered group (69 [62, 74] years vs. 40 [33, 57] years, Zâ€Š=â€Š9.738, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001). More patients in the death group had underlying diseases (72.5% vs. 41.5%, Ï‡2â€Š=â€Š22.105, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001). Patients in the death group had a significantly longer time of illness onset to hospitalization (10.0 [6.5, 12.0] days vs. 7.0 [5.0, 10.0] days, Zâ€Š=â€Š3.216, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.001). On admission, the proportion of patients with symptoms of dyspnea (70.6% vs. 24.7%, Ï‡2â€Š=â€Š60.905, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001) and expectoration (32.1% vs.15.7%, Ï‡2â€Š=â€Š13.250, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001) was significantly higher. The blood oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the death group (85 [77, 91]% vs. 97 [95, 98]%, Zâ€Š=â€Š10.625, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001). The white blood cell (WBC) in death group was higher on admission (7.23 [4.87, 11.17]â€ŠÃ—â€Š109/L vs. 4.52 [3.62, 5.88]â€ŠÃ—â€Š109/L, Zâ€Š=â€Š7.618, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001). Patients in the death group exhibited significantly lower lymphocyte count (0.63 [0.40, 0.79]â€ŠÃ—â€Š109/L vs. 1.00 [0.72, 1.27]â€ŠÃ—â€Š109/L, Zâ€Š=â€Š8.037, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001) and lymphocyte/WBC ratio (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 23.5 [15.27, 31.25]%, Zâ€Š=â€Š10.315, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001) on admission, and the lymphocyte/WBC ratio continue to decrease during hospitalization (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 2.91 [1.79, 6.13]%, Zâ€Š=â€Š5.242, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001). Alanine transaminase (ALT) (22.00 [15.00, 34.00] U/L vs. 18.70 [13.00, 30.38] U/L, Zâ€Š=â€Š2.592, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.010), aspartate transaminase (AST) (34.00 [27.00, 47.00] U/L vs. 22.00 [17.65, 31.75] U/L, Zâ€Š=â€Š7.308, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001), and creatinine levels (89.00 [72.00, 133.50] Î¼mol/L vs.65.00 [54.60, 78.75] Î¼mol/L, Zâ€Š=â€Š6.478, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001) were significantly higher in the death group that those in the recovered group. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly higher in the death group on admission (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] mg/L vs.3.22 [1.04, 21.80] mg/L, Zâ€Š=â€Š10.206, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001) showed no significant improvement after treatment (109.25 [35.0, 170.28] mg/L vs. 81.60 [27.23, 179.08] mg/L, Zâ€Š=â€Š1.219, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.233). The patients in the death group had more complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (89.9% vs. 7.6%, Ï‡2â€Š=â€Š148.105, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001), acute cardiac injury (59.6% vs. 0.8%, Ï‡2â€Š=â€Š93.222, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001), acute kidney injury (18.3% vs. 0, Ï‡2â€Š=â€Š23.257, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001), shock (11.9% vs. 0, Ï‡2â€Š=â€Š14.618, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (6.4% vs. 0, Ï‡2â€Š=â€Š7.655, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.006). Conclusions: Compared to the recovered group, more patients in the death group exhibited characteristics of advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities, dyspnea, oxygen saturation decrease, increased WBC count, decreased lymphocytes, and elevated CRP levels. More patients in the death groups had complications such as ARDS, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, shock, and DIC.

Clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus cases in tertiary hospitals in Hubei Province	Kui, Liu; Fang, Yuan-Yuan; Deng, Yan; Liu, Wei; Wang, Mei-Fang; Ma, Jing-Ping; Xiao, Wei; Wang, Ying-Nan; Zhong, Min-Hua; Li, Cheng-Hong; Li, Guang-Cai; Liu, Hui-Guo	BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province of China was isolated in January 2020. This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyzed the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak. METHODS: Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens. RESULTS: None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, mean age 55â€ŠÂ±â€Š16 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache. Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia. Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows. Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their condition. Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits. Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis. The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with 2019-nCoV coronavirus pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging. Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a poorer prognosis.	2020	NA	Chin Med J (Engl)	NA	NA	10.1097/CM9.0000000000000744	32044814	10.1097/CM9.0000000000000744	562	#691	Kui 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology	10.1097/CM9.0000000000000744	Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Taihe Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, Hubei 442000, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Jingzhou Central Hospital, Jingzhou, Hubei 434020, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First People's Hospital of Jingzhou, Jingzhou, Hubei 434000, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The People's Hospital of China Three Gorges University, The First People's Hospital of Yichang, Yichang, Hubei 443000, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Xiaogan Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology, The Central Hospital of Xiaogan, Xiaogan, Hubei 432100, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Sixth Hospital of Wuhan, Jianghan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430015, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonmous Prefecture, Enshi Clinical College, Wuhan University, Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hubei 445000, China.

Clinical Characteristics of 54 medical staff with COVID-19: A retrospective study in a single center in Wuhan, China	Chu, Jiaojiao; Yang, Nan; Wei, Yanqiu; Yue, Huihui; Zhang, Fengqin; Zhao, Jianping; He, Li; Sheng, Gaohong; Chen, Peng; Li, Gang; Wu, Sisi; Zhang, Bo; Zhang, Shu; Wang, Congyi; Miao, Xiaoping; Li, Juan; Liu, Wenhua; Zhang, Huilan	BACKGROUND: In December 2019, an outbreak of the SARS-Cov-2 infection occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to worldwide, which has attracted many people's concerns about the patients. However, studies on the infection status of medical personnels is still lacking. METHODS: 54 cases of SARS-Cov-2 infected medical staff from Tongji Hospital between January 7th to February 11th of 2020 were analyzed in this retrospective study. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were compared between different groups by statistical method. RESULTS: From January 7 to February 11, 2020, 54 medical staff of Tongji Hospital were hospitalized due to COVID-19. Most of them were from other clinical departments (72.2%) rather than emergency department (3.7%) or medical technology departments (18.5%). Among the 54 COVID-19 patients, the distribution of age had a significant difference between non-severe type and severe/critical cases (median age: 47 years vs. 38 years, p=0.0015). However, there was no statistical difference in terms of gender distribution and the first symptoms between theses two groups. Furthermore, we observed that the lesion regions in SARS-Cov-2 infected lungs with severe-/critical-type of medical staff were more likely to exhibit lesions in the right upper lobe (31.7% vs. 0%, P=0.028) and right lung (61% vs. 18.2%, P=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings with medical staff infection data, we suggest training for all hospital staff to prevent infection and preparation of sufficient protection and disinfection materials.

The Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Feces of COVID-19 Patients	Chen, Yifei; Chen, Liangjun; Deng, Qiaoling; Zhang, Guqin; Wu, Kaisong; Ni, Lan; Yang, Yibin; Liu, Bing; Wang, Wei; Wei, Chaojie; Yang, Jiong; Ye, Guangming; Cheng, Zhenshun	Abstract Background In December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China, and has spread globally. However, the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 has not been fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 shedding in excreta of COVID-19 patients. Methods Electronical medical records, including demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings, of enrolled patients were extracted and analyzed. Pharyngeal swab, stool and urine specimens were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. Viral shedding at multiple time points in specimens was recorded, and analyzed its correlation with clinical manifestations and the severity of illness. Results A total of 42 laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled, 8 (19.05%) of whom had gastrointestinal symptoms. 28 (66.67%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens, which was not associated with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of illness. Among them, 18 (64.29%) patients remained positive for viral RNA in feces after pharyngeal swabs turned negative. The duration of viral shedding from feces after negative conversion in pharyngeal swabs was 7 (6-10) days, regardless of COVID-19 severity. The demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiologic findings did no differ between patients tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces. Viral RNA was not detectable in urine specimens from 10 patients. Conclusions Our results demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces of COVID-19 patients, and suggested the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the fecal-oral route.

The isolation period should be longer: Lesson from a child infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Chongqing, China	Lin, Jilei; Duan, Jun; Tan, Tingdan; Fu, Zhou; Dai, Jihong	Abstract In December 2019, COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbroke in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, China. The disease rapidly spread to other areas in China due to a huge population movement during the New Year Festival. Here, a 7-year-old child with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Chongqing, outside of Wuhan, Hubei province, was reported. This case suggested that children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are more likely to present milder manifestations than adults. The continuous positive real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-CoV-2 in the child's throat swab sample indicated the isolation period for suspected child cases should be longer than 14 days.	2020	NA	Pediatric Pulmonology	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/ppul.24763	31023	#31507	Lin 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/ppul.24763	Department of Respiratory Disease, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation base of Child development and Critical Disorders, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China|Department of Pediatric, Fengdu People's Hospital of Chongqing, Chongqing, China|Department of Pediatric, Fengdu People's Hospital of Chongqing, Chongqing, China|Department of Respiratory Disease, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation base of Child development and Critical Disorders, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China|Department of Respiratory Disease, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation base of Child development and Critical Disorders, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China|Department of Respiratory Disease, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation base of Child development and Critical Disorders, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China|Department of Pediatric, Fengdu People's Hospital of Chongqing, Chongqing, China|Department of Pediatric, Fengdu People's Hospital of Chongqing, Chongqing, China|Department of Respiratory Disease, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation base of Child development and Critical Disorders, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China|Department of Respiratory Disease, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation base of Child development and Critical Disorders, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China	('China', 16)
Risk factors associated with disease progression in a cohort of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus	Zhou, Yulong; Zhang, Zhicheng; Tian, Jie; Xiong, Shaoyun	BACKGROUND: The emerging infection of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in late December, 2019 in Wuhan, China, has caused an extreme health concern, with many patients having progressed to acute respiratory disease or other complications in a short period. Meanwhile, the risk factors associated with the disease progression still remain elusive. METHODS: A cohort of 17 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections who were admitted to the Ninth Hospital of Nanchang between January 28 and February 6, 2020, were enrolled in this study. All the patients received standardized treatment. The disease progression was evaluated every 7 days after admission. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory characteristics were retrospectively analyzed, and the factors associated with the disease progression were screened by binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 11 women (64.7%) and 6 men (35.3%) between the ages of 18 to 70 years old. All patients had a reported history of contact with infection-confirmed patients. Fever (11/64.7%) and cough (8/47.1%) were the most common symptoms, whereas dyspnea (2/11.8%) and fatigue (3/17.6%) were rare, and there was no patient with diarrhea symptoms. There were 5 patients with aggravated disease at the first disease progression evaluation, and no patient received mechanical ventilation, transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), or progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, or death. Based on the disease progression, patients were divided into the non-aggravation group (12 cases) and the aggravation group (5 cases). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to their clinical characteristics. Chest computed tomography (CT) on admission revealed there were 8 patients (47.1%) with invasive lesions found bilaterally on the lungs on multiple lobes, 4 patients (23.5%) with invasive lesions on 1 lobe, and 5 patients (29.4%) with normal chest CT. The aggravation group had1 patient (20.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 3 (60.0%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 1 (20.0%) with normal chest CT; meanwhile, the nonaggravation group had 3 patients (25.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 5 (41.7%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 4 (33.3%) with normal chest CT. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups. In the aggravation group, the total lymphocyte counts significantly decreased in comparison to that in the non-aggravation group. Further analysis showed that the CD4+ T cell count but not the CD8+ T cell count of the aggravation group was significantly lower than that of the non-aggravation group. Correlation analysis indicated total lymphocyte count was positively correlated with CD4+ T cell count, and no significant differences were found between the 2 groups in other laboratory measurements, including those of white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. Finally, a binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with the disease progression. It was found that total lymphocyte count was a risk factor associated with disease progression in patients infected with 2019-nCoV. CONCLUSIONS: A higher cell count of total lymphocytes may indicate a better outcome of the disease, and immune response may be a vital factor for directing disease progression in the early stage of 2019-nCoV infection.	2020	NA	Ann Palliat Med	NA	NA	NA	32233642	10.21037/apm.2020.03.26	31801	#31848	Zhou 2020	NA	NA	10.21037/apm.2020.03.26	Department of Respiratory Medicine, 	NA

Several patients displayed no obvious clinical symptoms at diagnosis, and they were found by screening because of close contacts with confirmed patients; and further chest imaging suggested pneumonia. Several gradually presented with fever, fatigue, dry cough, accompanied by other upper respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion, runny nose, and seldom gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Laboratory examination in pediatric patients showed that blood routine was often normal, and C-reactive protein was normal or transiently elevated. Lung imaging examination revealed mild increase of lung markings or ground-glass opacity or pneumoniaID - Shen2020	2020	NA	World Journal of Pediatrics	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s12519-020-00344-6	497	#276	Shen 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s12519-020-00344-6	Department of Respiratory Medicine, Beijing Children‚Äôs Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China	('China', 1)

Respiratory microbiome and epithelial interactions shape immunity in the lungs	Invernizzi, Rachele; Lloyd, Clare M.; Molyneaux, Philip L.	Abstract The airway epithelium represents a physical barrier to the external environment acting as the first line of defence against potentially harmful environmental stimuli including microbes and allergens. However, lung epithelial cells are increasingly recognised as active effectors of microbial defence, contributing to both innate and adaptive immune function in the lower respiratory tract. These cells express an ample repertoire of pattern-recognition receptors with specificity for conserved microbial and host motifs. Modern molecular techniques have uncovered the complexity of the lower respiratory tract microbiome. The interaction between the microbiota and the airway epithelium is key to understanding how stable immune homeostasis is maintained. Loss of epithelial integrity following exposure to infection can result in the onset of inflammation in susceptible individuals and may culminate in lung disease. Here we discuss the current knowledge regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the pulmonary epithelium interacts with the lung microbiome in shaping immunity in the lung. Specifically, we focus on the interactions between the lung microbiome and the cells of the conducting airways in modulating immune cell regulation and how defects in barrier structure and function may culminate in lung disease. Understanding these interactions is fundamental in the search for more effective therapies for respiratory diseases.	2020	NA	Immunology	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/imm.13195	12345	#11413	Invernizzi 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Other related diseases and viruses	10.1111/imm.13195	Department of Respiratory Medicine, Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK|Department of Respiratory Medicine, Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK	('UK', 2)
Primary stratification and identification of suspected Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from clinical perspective by a simple scoring proposal	Zhou, Ting-Ting; Wei, Feng-Xian	In this Commentary, we would like to comment on the article titled â€œA rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)â€ as a featured article in Military Medical Research. In the guideline, except for â€œconfirmed casesâ€, â€œsuspected casesâ€, â€œclose contactâ€ and â€œsuspicious exposureâ€ were defined by clinical perspective based on epidemiological risk, clinical symptoms and auxiliary examination. Combined with our experience, we introduced a simple scoring proposal additionally based on not only CT imaging as strongly recommended by the guideline but also blood routine test, especially for primary screening of such patients in the out-patient department.	2020	NA	Military Medical Research	7	1	16-16	NA	10.1186/s40779-020-00246-8	30972	#31674	Zhou 2020	NA	NA	10.1186/s40779-020-00246-8	Department of Respiratory Medicine, Lanzhou University Second Hospital, Lanzhou, 730030, Gansu, China	('China', 1)

Composition and divergence of coronavirus spike proteins and host ACE2 receptors predict potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2	Liu, Zhixin; Xiao, Xiao; Wei, Xiuli; Li, Jian; Yang, Jing; Tan, Huabing; Zhu, Jianyong; Zhang, Qiwei; Wu, Jianguo; Liu, Long	From the beginning of 2002 and 2012, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) crossed the species barriers to infect humans caused thousands of infections and hundreds of deaths, respectively. Currently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes the outbreaks of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered. Until February 18, 2020, there are 72533 confirmed COVID-19 cases (including 10644 severe cases) and 1872 deaths in China. SARS-CoV-2 is surging in the public and caused substantial burdens due to its human-to-human transmission. However, the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. Finding the possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to prevent further spread of the epidemic. In this study, we used systematic comparison and analysis to predict the interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of coronavirus spike protein and the host receptor, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). The interaction between the key amino acids of S protein RBD and ACE2 indicated that like previous suggested pangolins and snacks, the turtles (C. picta bellii, C. mydas, and P. sinensis) may act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to human.

Detectable SARS-CoV-2 Viral RNA in Feces of Three Children during Recovery Period of COVID-19 Pneumonia	Zhang, Tongqiang; Cui, Xiaojian; Zhao, Xue; Wang, Jinhu; Zheng, Jiafeng; Zheng, Guifen; Guo, Wei; Cai, Chunquan; He, Sijia; Xu, Yongsheng	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). After its first occurrence in Wuhan of China from December 2019, COVID-19 rapidly spread around the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) statement on March 13, 2020, there had been over 132,500 confirmed cases globally. Nevertheless, the case reports of children are rare, which result in the lack of evidence for preventing and controlling of children's infection. Here, we report 3 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infected children diagnosed from February 3 to February 17, 2020 in Tianjin, China. All of these three cases experienced mild illness and recovered soon after treatment, with the nucleic acid of throat swab turning negative within 14, 11, 7 days after diagnosis respectively. However, after been discharged, all the three cases were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive in the stool samples within 10 days, in spite of their remained negative nucleic acid in throat swab specimens. Therefore, it is necessary to be aware of the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially for children cases. This article is protected by copyright.

The progress of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) event in China	Guan, Wang; Xian, Jin	It has been more than one month since the first 2019-nCov infected person was diagnosed. However, the number of cumulative cases is keeping upward, including the severe cases and death cases. It has been proved that droplets transmission is the major route for 2019-nCov infection, and interpersonal contact could also cause the disease. Due to the fast-growing of Wuhan pneumonia and relative low cure rate, Chinese government is facing great challenges, and has taken emergency measures on disease prevention and clinical treatment, including population mobility control, building five or more hospitals for Wuhan pneumonia treatment, such as "Huo Shen Shan" hospital as well as developing a specific vaccine. In the meanwhile, the government shared the updated Genome Sequence of 2019-nCoV to the public, and scientists from China and oversea are working tightly and efficiently on public health emergency.

Transmission dynamics and evolutionary history of 2019-nCoV	Li, Xingguang; Wang, Wei; Zhao, Xiaofang; Zai, Junjie; Zhao, Qiang; Li, Yi; Chaillon, Antoine	To investigate the time origin, genetic diversity, and transmission dynamics of the recent 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and beyond, a total of 32 genomes of virus strains sampled from China, Thailand, and the USA with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020 were analyzed. Phylogenetic, transmission network, and likelihood-mapping analyses of the genome sequences were performed. On the basis of the likelihood-mapping analysis, the increasing tree-like signals (from 0% to 8.2%, 18.2%, and 25.4%) over time may be indicative of increasing genetic diversity of 2019-nCoV in human hosts. We identified three phylogenetic clusters using the Bayesian inference framework and three transmission clusters using transmission network analysis, with only one cluster identified by both methods using the above genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains. The estimated mean evolutionary rate for 2019-nCoV ranged from 1.7926 x 10(-3) to 1.8266 x 10(-3) substitutions per site per year. On the basis of our study, undertaking epidemiological investigations and genomic data surveillance could positively impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce 2019-nCOV transmission in real-time.	2020	NA	Journal of Medical Virology	92	5	501-511	WOS:000513293400001	10.1002/jmv.25701	10702	#10501	Li 2020	NA	Epidemiology; Virology, immunology	10.1002/jmv.25701	Department of Spleen and Stomach Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, China|Department of Science and Technology, Ruikang Hospital Affiliated to Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, China|Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California|Department of Spleen and Stomach Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, China|Department of Science and Technology, Ruikang Hospital Affiliated to Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, China|Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California	('China', 4)|('uika', 2)

We identified three phylogenetic clusters using the Bayesian inference framework and three transmission clusters using transmission network analysis, with only one cluster identified by both methods using the above genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains. The estimated mean evolutionary rate for 2019-nCoV ranged from 1.7926 ? 10-3 to 1.8266 ? 10-3 substitutions per site per year. Based on our study, undertaking epidemiological investigations and genomic data surveillance could positively impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce 2019-nCOV transmission in real time.

The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy: initial implications for organ transplantation programs	Angelico, R.; Trapani, S.; Manzia, T. M.; Lombardini, L.; Tisone, G.; Cardillo, M.	Abstract The spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already reached a pandemic dimension within few weeks. Italy has been one of the first countries dealing with the outbreak of COVID-19 and severe measures have been adopted to limit viral transmission. The spread of COVID-19 may have several implications in organ transplant activity that physicians should be aware of. The initial experience gained during the COVID-19 outbreak shows that around 10% of infected patients in Italy need intensive care management to overcome the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Due to the exponential rise of infected patients we are now facing an actual risk of saturation of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. A restriction in the number of ICU beds available for both donors and transplant recipients may unfavorably influence the overall donation activity, and eventually lead to a reduced number of transplants. Preliminary Italian data show that a 25% reduction of procured organs has already occurred during the first 4 weeks of COVID-19 outbreak. This underlines the need to closely monitor what will be further happening in ICUs due to the COVID-19 spread in the attempt to preserve transplant activity, especially in Western countries where deceased donors represent the major organ resource.	2020	NA	American Journal of Transplantation	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/ajt.15904	31083	#30785	Angelico 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/ajt.15904	Department of Surgery Science, Transplant and HPB Unit, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy|Department of Surgery Science, Transplant and HPB Unit, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy|Department of Surgery Science, Transplant and HPB Unit, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy|Department of Surgery Science, Transplant and HPB Unit, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy|Department of Surgery Science, Transplant and HPB Unit, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy|Department of Surgery Science, Transplant and HPB Unit, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy	('Italy', 6)

The possible impact of COVID-19 on colorectal surgery in Italy	Lisi, G.; Campanelli, M.; Spoletini, D.; Carlini, M.	The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy is stopping access to elective benign disease treatment and changing the approach to malignant disease as well as the outpatients care of those patients treated for colorectal cancer. The lack of knowledge about the possible implications of the spread of the infection during surgery could extend to infect surgeons, surgery nurses and also the anesthesiologists, the results will become evident in the long term. The surgical approach may change going towards less invasive procedures to minimize the aerosolized biological fluids, this approach could reduce the access to first level hospitals changing the entire health care system in the future.	2020	NA	Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/codi.15054	21087	#20595	Lisi 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/codi.15054	Department of Surgery, Sant‚ÄôEugenio Hospital, viale dell‚ÄôUmanesimo 10, 00144 Rome, Italy|Department of Surgery, Sant‚ÄôEugenio Hospital, viale dell‚ÄôUmanesimo 10, 00144 Rome, Italy|Department of Surgery, Sant‚ÄôEugenio Hospital, viale dell‚ÄôUmanesimo 10, 00144 Rome, Italy|Department of Surgery, Sant‚ÄôEugenio Hospital, viale dell‚ÄôUmanesimo 10, 00144 Rome, Italy|Department of Surgery, Sant‚ÄôEugenio Hospital, viale dell‚ÄôUmanesimo 10, 00144 Rome, Italy|Department of Surgery, Sant‚ÄôEugenio Hospital, viale dell‚ÄôUmanesimo 10, 00144 Rome, Italy	('Italy', 6)
COVID-19: A Global Transplant Perspective on Successfully Navigating a Pandemic	Kumar, Deepali; Manuel, Oriol; Natori, Yoichiro; Egawa, Hiroto; Grossi, Paolo; Han, Sang-Hoon; Fernandez-Ruiz, Mario; Humar, Atul	Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly evolved and changed our way of life in an unprecedented manner. The emergence of COVID-19 has impacted transplantation worldwide. The impact has not been just restricted to issues pertaining to donors or recipients, but also health care resource utilization as the intensity of cases in certain jurisdictions exceeds available capacity. Here we provide a personal viewpoint representing different jurisdictions from around the world in order to outline the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on organ transplantation. Based on our collective experience, we discuss mitigation strategies such as donor screening, resource planning and a staged approach to transplant volume considerations as local resource issues demand. We also discuss issues related to transplant-related research during the pandemic, the role of transplant infectious diseases and the influence of transplant societies for education and disseminating current information.	2020	NA	American Journal of Transplantation	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/ajt.15876	12532	#11719	Kumar 2020	NA	* Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Infection prevention and control	10.1111/ajt.15876	Department of Surgery, Tokyo Women‚Äôs Medical University, Tokyo, Japan|Department of Surgery, Tokyo Women‚Äôs Medical University, Tokyo, Japan	('Japan', 2)
Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) Treatment for COVID-19 Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): A Case Series	Wang, Janice; Hajizadeh, Negin; Moore, Ernest E.; McIntyre, Robert C.; Moore, Peter K.; Veress, Livia A.; Yaffe, Michael B.; Moore, Hunter B.; Barrett, Christopher D.	Abstract A hallmark of severe COVID-19 is coagulopathy, with 71.4% of patients who die of COVID-19 meeting ISTH criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) while only 0.6% of patients who survive meet these criteria (1). Additionally, it has become clear that this is not a bleeding diathesis but rather a predominantly pro-thrombotic DIC with high venous thromboembolism rates, elevated D-dimer levels, high fibrinogen levels in concert with low anti-thrombin levels, and pulmonary congestion with microvascular thrombosis and occlusion on pathology in addition to mounting experience with high rates of central line thrombosis and vascular occlusive events (e.g. ischemic limbs, strokes, etc.) observed by those who care for critically ill COVID-19 patients (1-7). There is evidence in both animals and humans that fibrinolytic therapy in Acute Lung Injury and ARDS improves survival, which also points to fibrin deposition in the pulmonary microvasculature as a contributory cause of ARDS and would be expected to be seen in patients with ARDS and concomitant diagnoses of DIC on their laboratory values such as what is observed in more than 70% of those who die of COVID-19 (8-10).	2020	NA	Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/jth.14828	45176	#42076	Wang 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/jth.14828	Department of Surgery, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA|Department of Surgery, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA|Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA|Department of Pediatrics, Pulmonary Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado, USA|Department of Surgery, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA|Department of Surgery, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA|Department of Surgery, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA|Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA|Department of Pediatrics, Pulmonary Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado, USA|Department of Surgery, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA	('USA', 10)

Clinical strategies for treating pediatric cancer during the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection	Yang, Chao; Li, Changchun; Wang, Shan; National Clinical Research Center for Child, Health; Disorders; Children's Oncology Committee of Chinese Research Hospital, Association	Since December 2019, a novel type of coronavirus (SARSâ€CoVâ€2) infection, which first appeared in China, has spread to over 20 countries around the world.1 By February 19, 2020, more than 74 000 cases had been confirmed, with more than 2000 deaths, and hundreds of thousands of people are under close medical observation. About 300 children have been diagnosed; however, children with cancer are assumed to be more susceptible to this coronavirus, as thier immune function may be suppressed. The purpose of this letter is to provide suggestions on how to choose a reasonable treatment strategy between epidemic prevention and anticancer therapy under the current epidemic conditions.Due to few cases being diagnosed in pediatrics, most of our suggestions are from existing and previous experiences in adults. These suggestions may be modified after accumulating clinical evidence and experience. Pediatric oncologists should continually update their knowledge on the prevention and control of SARSâ€CoVâ€2 in children with cancer.	2020	NA	Pediatric Blood & Cancer	n/a	n/a	e28248	NA	10.1002/pbc.28248	5848	#5700	Yang 2020	NA	* Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1002/pbc.28248	Department of Surgical Oncology, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014 China|Department of Surgical Oncology, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014 China|Department of Surgical Oncology, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014 China|Department of Surgical Oncology, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014 China|Department of Surgical Oncology, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014 China|Department of Surgical Oncology, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014 China|Department of Surgical Oncology, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014 China|Department of Surgical Oncology, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014 China	('China', 16)

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) by stratifying the comorbidity status. METHODS: We analysed the data from 1590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalised patients 575 hospitals in 31 province/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across mainland China between December 11(th), 2019 and January 31(st), 2020. We analyse the composite endpoints, which consisted of admission to intensive care unit, or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared according to the presence and number of comorbidities. RESULTS: The mean age was 48.9â€…years. 686 patients (42.7%) were females. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (16.9%), followed by diabetes (8.2%). 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. After adjusting for age and smoking status, COPD [hazards ratio (HR) 2.681, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.424-5.048], diabetes (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.03-2.45), hypertension (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.07-2.32) and malignancy (HR 3.50, 95%CI 1.60-7.64) were risk factors of reaching to the composite endpoints. The HR was 1.79 (95%CI 1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (95%CI 1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Among laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19, patients with any comorbidity yielded poorer clinical outcomes than those without. A greater number of comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes.	2020	NA	The European respiratory journal	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1183/13993003.00547-2020	17692	#18269	Guan 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.1183/13993003.00547-2020	Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China|Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China	('China', 28)
Lung transplantation as therapeutic option in acute respiratory distress syndrome for COVID-19-related pulmonary fibrosis	Chen, Jing-Yu; Qiao, Kun; Liu, Feng; Wu, Bo; Xu, Xin; Jiao, Guo-Qing; Lu, Rong-Guo; Li, Hui-Xing; Zhao, Jin; Huang, Jian; Yang, Yi; Lu, Xiao-Jie; Li, Jia-Shu; Jiang, Shu-Yun; Wang, Da-Peng; Hu, Chun-Xiao; Wang, Gui-Long; Huang, Dong-Xiao; Jiao, Guo-Hui; Wei, Dong; Ye, Shu-Gao; Huang, Jian-An; Zhou, Li; Zhang, Xiao-Qin; He, Jian-Xing	BACKGROUND: Critical patients with the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), even those whose nucleic acid test results had turned negative and those receiving maximal medical support, have been noted to progress to irreversible fatal respiratory failure. Lung transplantation (LT) as the sole therapy for end-stage pulmonary fibrosis related to acute respiratory distress syndrome has been considered as the ultimate rescue therapy for these patients. METHODS: From February 10 to March 10, 2020, three male patients were urgently assessed and listed for transplantation. After conducting a full ethical review and after obtaining assent from the family of the patients, we performed three LT procedures for COVID-19 patients with illness durations of >1 month and extremely high sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores. RESULTS: Two of the three recipients survived post-LT and started participating in a rehabilitation program. Pearls of the LT team collaboration and perioperative logistics were summarized and continually improved. The pathological results of the explanted lungs were concordant with the critical clinical manifestation, and provided insight towards better understanding of the disease. Government health affair systems, virology detection tools, and modern communication technology all play key roles towards the survival of the patients and their rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplantation can be performed in end-stage patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19-related pulmonary fibrosis. If confirmed positive-turned-negative virology status without organ dysfunction, LT provided the final option for these patients to avoid certain death, with proper protection of transplant surgeons and medical staffs. By ensuring instant seamless care for both patients and medical teams, the goal of reducing the mortality rate and salvaging the lives of patients with COVID-19 can be attained.	2020	NA	Chin Med J (Engl)	NA	NA	NA	32251003	10.1097/CM9.0000000000000839	41569	#41718	Chen 2020	NA	NA	10.1097/CM9.0000000000000839	Department of Thoracic Surgery, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Shenzhen 518100, China.|Department of Thoracic Surgery/Oncology State Key Laboratory and National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510120, China.|Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Wuxi People's Hospital affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214023, China.|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210009, China.|Department of Respiratory Medicine and Critical Care Medicine, The First People's Hospital of Lian Yungang city, Jiangsu 222061, China.|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuxi People's Hospital affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214023, China.|Department of Anesthesiology, Wuxi People's Hospital affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214023, China.|Department of Respiratory Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006, China.

Clinical and Transmission Characteristics of Covid-19 â€” A Retrospective Study of 25 Cases from a Single Thoracic Surgery Department	Li, Yang-Kai; Peng, Shu; Li, Le-Qun; Wang, Qi; Ping, Wei; Zhang, Ni; Fu, Xiang-Ning	The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (Covid-19) imposes a major challenge in managing patients undergoing surgical operation. In this study, we analyzed clinical and transmission features of 25 cases of Covid-19 from a single thoracic department, including 13 patients and 12 health care staff. There were 13 males and 12 females. The median age of the patients was 61 (range: 51 to 69) years. The median age of the health care staff was 35 (range: 22 to 51) years. By the end of follow-up date (Mar. 3, 2020), there were 16 non-severe cases (64%) and 9 severe cases (36%), 5 cases were dead (20%). Nineteen (76%) of the infected cases were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, the rest were clinically diagnosed as suspected Covid-19 cases, and 19 (76%) of the infected cases had positive exposure history. We found that COPD was significantly associated with severity and death (P=0.040, and P=0.038, respectively), and chest operation was significantly associated with death for Covid-19 patients (P=0.039). A potential â€œsuper spreaderâ€ may be the source of the transmission before the implementation of quarantine and comprehensive protection. It was concluded that Covid-19 is associated with poor prognosis for patients undergoing thoracic operation, especially for those with COPD. Implementation of comprehensive protective measures is important to control nosocomial infection.	2020	NA	Current Medical Science	NA	NA	6-Jan	NA	10.1007/s11596-020-2176-2	19169	#19574	Li 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s11596-020-2176-2	Department of Thoracic Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China	('China', 1)

A new threat from an old enemy: Reemergence of coronavirus (Review)	Docea, Anca Oana; Tsatsakis, Aristidis; Albulescu, Dana; Cristea, Oana; Zlatian, Ovidiu; Vinceti, Marco; Moschos, Sterghios A.; Tsoukalas, Dimitris; Goumenou, Marina; Drakoulis, Nikolaos; Dumanov, Josef M.; Tutelyan, Victor A.; Onischenko, Gennadii G.; Aschner, Michael; Spandidos, Demetrios A.; Calina, Daniela	The new outbreak of coronavirus from December 2019 has brought attention to an old viral enemy and has raised concerns as to the ability of current protection measures and the healthcare system to handle such a threat. It has been known since the 1960s that coronaviruses can cause respiratory infections in humans; however, their epidemic potential was understood only during the past two decades. In the present review, we address current knowledge on coronaviruses from a short history to epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation of the disease, as well as treatment and prevention strategies. Although a great amount of research and efforts have been made worldwide to prevent further outbreaks of coronavirusassociated disease, the spread and lethality of the 2019 outbreak (COVID19) is proving to be higher than previous epidemics on account of international travel density and immune naivety of the population. Only strong, joint and coordinated efforts of worldwide healthcare systems, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies and receptive national leaders will succeed in suppressing an outbreak of this scale.	2020	NA	Int J Mol Med	NA	NA	NA	32236624	10.3892/ijmm.2020.4555	31701	#32780	Docea 2020	NA	NA	10.3892/ijmm.2020.4555	Department of Toxicology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, 200349 Craiova, Romania, Department of Forensic Sciences and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Crete, 71003 Heraklion, Greece, Department of Radiology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, 200349 Craiova, Romania, Department of Microbiology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, 200349 Craiova, Romania, Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, I‚Äë41125 Modena, Italy, Department of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University, Newcastle‚ÄëUpon‚ÄëTyne NE1 8ST, UK, Metabolomic Medicine, Health Clinics for Autoimmune and Chronic Diseases, 10674 Athens, Greece, Research Group of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacogenomics, Faculty of Pharmacy, School of Health Sciences, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 15771 Athens, Greece, Mycological Institute US EU, Subclinical Research Group, Sparta, NJ 07871, USA, Russian Academy of Sciences, 119991 Moscow, Russia, The State Education Institution of Higher Professional Training, The First Sechenov Moscow State Medical University under Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, 119992 Moscow, Russia, Laboratory of Clinical Virology, School of Medicine, University of Crete, 71003 Heraklion, Greece, Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, 200349 Craiova, Romania	('Romania', 4)|('Greece', 4)|('Russia', 4)|('Italy', 1)|('UK', 1)|('USA', 1)
Urban Intelligence for Pandemic Response: Viewpoint	Yuan, Lai; Yeung, Wesley; Celi, Leo Anthony	UNSTRUCTURED: Previous epidemic management research proves the importance of city-level information, but also highlights limited expertise in urban data applications during a pandemic outbreak. In this paper, we provide an overview of city-level information, in combination with analytical and operational capacity, that define urban intelligence for supporting response to disease outbreaks. We present five components (movement, facilities, people, information, engagement) that have been previously investigated but remain siloed to successfully orchestrate an integrated pandemic response. Reflecting on the COVID-19 outbreak that was first identified in Wuhan, China, we discuss the opportunities, technical challenges, and foreseeable controversies for deploying urban intelligence during a pandemic. Finally, we emphasize the urgency of building urban intelligence through cross-disciplinary research and collaborative practice at the global scale.	2020	NA	JMIR Public Health Surveill	NA	NA	NA	32248145	10.2196/18873	34675	#35678	Yuan 2020	NA	NA	10.2196/18873	Department of Urban Studies and Planning, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States	('United States', 1)

COVID-19 Pandemic - Is Virtual Urology Clinic the answer to keeping the cancer pathway moving?	Connor, M. J.; Winkler, M.; Miah, S.	The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to our National Health Service (NHS) (1). As the need to appropriately direct all efforts towards providing emergency supportive care to those suffering, there will be a knee-jerk tendency to cancel all outpatient activity by NHS trusts. Whilst this appears to be a pragmatic approach to reducing risk of transmission, there will be an unmet cost to those patients who are high-risk and are already on the cancer referral pathway.	2020	NA	BJU Int	NA	NA	NA	32232915	10.1111/bju.15061	27186	#29993	Connor 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/bju.15061	Department of Urology, Addenbrooke‚Äôs Hospital, Cambridge, UK|Department of Urology, Addenbrooke‚Äôs Hospital, Cambridge, UK	('UK', 2)

Medical and surgical priorities were changed dramatically at the time of this pandemic. Postponement for all outpatient and elective activities to save facilities and resources for urgent cases and Covid-19 patients was adopted by most of hospitals in the affected countries. Over the coming weeks healthcare workers including urologists will be facing increasingly difficult challenges and consequently they should adopt sufficient protection strategies to guard against infection when dealing with COVID-19 patients. In this review we discussed the impact of Covid-19 on global health, urinary tract and uro-oncologic surgeries . Additionally, we reviewed some of the available recommendations reported on oncological surgeries practice during this pandemic.	2020	NA	BJU international	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/bju.15071	34293	#35103	Puliatti 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/bju.15071	Department of Urology, Onze Lieve Vrouw Hospital, Aalst, Belgium|Department of Urology, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan, Italy|Department of Urology, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan, Italy|Department of Urology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden|Department of urology, Instituto do C√¢ncer do Estado de S√£o Paulo (Icesp), SP, S√£o Paulo, Brazil|Department of Urology, Guy's and St, Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, King's Health Partners, London, United Kingdom|Department of Urology, Onze Lieve Vrouw Hospital, Aalst, Belgium|Department of Urology, Onze Lieve Vrouw Hospital, Aalst, Belgium|Department of Urology, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan, Italy|Department of Urology, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan, Italy|Department of Urology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden|Department of urology, Instituto do C√¢ncer do Estado de S√£o Paulo (Icesp), SP, S√£o Paulo, Brazil|Department of Urology, Guy's and St, Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, King's Health Partners, London, United Kingdom|Department of Urology, Onze Lieve Vrouw Hospital, Aalst, Belgium	('Belgium', 4)|('Italy', 4)|('Sweden', 2)|('Brazil', 2)|('United Kingdom', 2)

Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses	Cui, Jie; Li, Fang; Shi, Zheng-Li	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are two highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses that emerged in humans at the beginning of the 21st century. Both viruses likely originated in bats, and genetically diverse coronaviruses that are related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were discovered in bats worldwide. In this Review, we summarize the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of these two pathogenic coronaviruses and discuss their receptor usage; we also highlight the diversity and potential of spillover of bat-borne coronaviruses, as evidenced by the recent spillover of swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) to pigs.	2019	NA	Nat Rev Microbiol	17	3	181-192	30531947	10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9	911	#1405	Cui 2019	NA	* Narrative review; Epidemiology; Other related diseases and viruses; Reservoir; Virology, immunology	10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9	Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, MN, USA	('USA', 1)
Structural basis of receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2	Shang, Jian; Ye, Gang; Shi, Ke; Wan, Yushun; Luo, Chuming; Aihara, Hideki; Geng, Qibin; Auerbach, Ashley; Li, Fang	A novel SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) recently emerged and is rapidly spreading in humans1,2. A key to tackling this epidemic is to understand the virusâ€™s receptor recognition mechanism, which regulates its infectivity, pathogenesis and host range. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV recognize the same receptor - human ACE2 (hACE2)3,4. Here we determined the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) (engineered to facilitate crystallization) in complex with hACE2. Compared with the SARS-CoV RBD, a hACE2-binding ridge in SARS-CoV-2 RBD takes a more compact conformation; moreover, several residue changes in SARS-CoV-2 RBD stabilize two virus-binding hotspots at the RBD/hACE2 interface. These structural features of SARS-CoV-2 RBD enhance its hACE2-binding affinity. Additionally, we show that RaTG13, a bat coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2, also uses hACE2 as its receptor. The differences among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and RaTG13 in hACE2 recognition shed light on potential animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This study provides guidance for intervention strategies targeting receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2.	2020	NA	Nature	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1038/s41586-020-2179-y	19007	#19453	Shang 2020	NA	Virology, immunology	10.1038/s41586-020-2179-y	Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, MN, USA|Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA	('USA', 2)

P.; Drosten, C.	BackgroundThe ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers does already occur.AimWe aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available.MethodsHere we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology.ResultsThe workflow reliably detects 2019-nCoV, and further discriminates 2019-nCoV from SARS-CoV. Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a full spectrum of human respiratory viruses. Control material is made available through European Virus Archive - Global (EVAg), a European Union infrastructure project.ConclusionThe present study demonstrates the enormous response capacity achieved through coordination of academic and public laboratories in national and European research networks.	2020	NA	Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin	25	3	NA	NA	10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045	479	#233	Corman 2020	NA	Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Virology, immunology	10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045	Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands|University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China|Department of Medical Microbiology, Vaccine and Infectious Diseases Institute, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium	('Netherlands', 1)|('China', 1)|('Belgium', 1)

We report the case of a young man with documented nCoV-19 infection evaluated with lung ultrasound and discuss potential applications of lung ultrasound in this setting. Lung ultrasound allowed the identification of nCoV-19 infection at bed-side. Moreover, lung ultrasound can have several other advantages, such as reduced health worker exposition to infected patients, repeatability during follow-up, low-costs and easier application in low-resource settings.	2020	NA	European review for medical and pharmacological sciences	24	5	2776-2780	32196627	10.26355/eurrev_202003_20549	11649	#11541	Buonsenso 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.26355/eurrev_202003_20549	Department of Woman and Child Health and Public Health, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China	Kraemer, M. U. G.; Yang, C. H.; Gutierrez, B.; Wu, C. H.; Klein, B.; Pigott, D. M.; du Plessis, L.; Faria, N. R.; Li, R.; Hanage, W. P.; Brownstein, J. S.; Layan, M.; Vespignani, A.; Tian, H.; Dye, C.; Pybus, O. G.; Scarpino, S. V.	The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions have been undertaken to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.	2020	NA	Science (New York, N.Y.)

An investigation of transmission control measures during the first 50 days of the COVID-19 epidemic in China	Tian, Huaiyu; Liu, Yonghong; Li, Yidan; Wu, Chieh-Hsi; Chen, Bin; Kraemer, Moritz U. G.; Li, Bingying; Cai, Jun; Xu, Bo; Yang, Qiqi; Wang, Ben; Yang, Peng; Cui, Yujun; Song, Yimeng; Zheng, Pai; Wang, Quanyi; Bjornstad, Ottar N.; Yang, Ruifu; Grenfell, Bryan T.; Pybus, Oliver G.; Dye, Christopher	Responding to an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (agent of COVID-19) in December 2019, China banned travel to and from Wuhan city on 23 January and implemented a national emergency response. We investigated the spread and control of COVID-19 using a unique data set including case reports, human movement and public health interventions. The Wuhan shutdown was associated with the delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days (95%CI: 2.54-3.29). Cities that implemented control measures pre-emptively reported fewer cases, on average, in the first week of their outbreaks (13.0; 7.1-18.8) compared with cities that started control later (20.6; 14.5-26.8). Suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings were associated with reductions in case incidence. The national emergency response appears to have delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, averting hundreds of thousands of cases by 19 February (day 50).	2020	NA	Science	NA	NA	eabb6105	NA	10.1126/science.abb6105	21145	#20742	Tian 2020	NA	NA	10.1126/science.abb6105	Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.|Department of Land, Air and Water Resources, University of California Davis, CA, USA.|Department of Urban Planning and Design, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.|Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Peking University, China.|Department of Entomology, College of Agricultural Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA.|Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA.|Department of Land, Air and Water Resources, University of California Davis, CA, USA.|Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.|Department of Urban Planning and Design, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.|Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Peking University, China.|Department of Entomology, College of Agricultural Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA.|Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA.|Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.|Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.

Epidemiological data from the COVID-19 outbreak, real-time case information	Xu, Bo; Gutierrez, Bernardo; Mekaru, Sumiko; Sewalk, Kara; Goodwin, Lauren; Loskill, Alyssa; Cohn, Emily L.; Hswen, Yulin; Hill, Sarah C.; Cobo, Maria M.; Zarebski, Alexander E.; Li, Sabrina; Wu, Chieh-Hsi; Hulland, Erin; Morgan, Julia D.; Wang, Lin; O'Brien, Katelynn; Scarpino, Samuel V.; Brownstein, John S.; Pybus, Oliver G.; Pigott, David M.; Kraemer, Moritz U. G.	Cases of a novel coronavirus were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and have since spread across the world. Epidemiological studies have indicated human-to-human transmission in China and elsewhere. To aid the analysis and tracking of the COVID-19 epidemic we collected and curated individual-level data from national, provincial, and municipal health reports, as well as additional information from online reports. All data are geo-coded and, where available, include symptoms, key dates (date of onset, admission, and confirmation), and travel history. The generation of detailed, real-time, and robust data for emerging disease outbreaks is important and can help to generate robust evidence that will support and inform public health decision making.	2020	NA	Scientific data	7	1	106-106	NA	10.1038/s41597-020-0448-0	16686	#15533	Xu 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.1038/s41597-020-0448-0	Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom|Department of Health Metrics Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, United States|Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States|Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom|Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, United States|Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom	('United Kingdom', 3)|('United States', 3)
Migraine Care in the Era of COVID-19: Clinical Pearls and Plea to Insurers	Szperka, Christina L.; Ailani, Jessica; Barmherzig, Rebecca; Klein, Brad C.; Minen, Mia T.; Halker Singh, Rashmi B.; Shapiro, Robert E.	Abstract Objective To outline strategies for the treatment of migraine which do not require in-person visits to clinic or the emergency department, and to describe ways that health insurance companies can remove barriers to quality care for migraine. Background COVID-19 is a global pandemic causing wide-spread infections and death. To control the spread of infection we are called to observe ?social distancing? and we have been asked to postpone any procedures which are not essential. Since procedural therapies are a mainstay of headache care, the inability to do procedures could negatively affect our patients with migraine. In this manuscript we review alternative therapies, with particular attention to those which may be contra-indicated in the setting of COVID-19 infection. Design/Results The manuscript reviews the use of telemedicine visits and acute, bridge, and preventive therapies for migraine. We focus on evidence-based treatment where possible, but also describe ?real world? strategies which may be tried. In each section we call out areas where changes to rules from commercial health insurance companies would facilitate better migraine care. Conclusions Our common goal as health care providers is to maximize the health and safety of our patients. Successful management of migraine with avoidance of in-person patient clinic and emergency department visits further benefits the current urgent overall societal goal of maintaining social distance to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.	2020	NA	Headache: The Journal of Head and Face Pain	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/head.13810	19178	#19437	Szperka 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/head.13810	Departments of Neurology & Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA|Department of Neurology, Medstar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC, USA|Department of Neurology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA|Departments of Neurology and Population Health, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, USA|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ, USA|Department of Neurological Sciences, Larner College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VA, USA|Departments of Neurology & Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA|Department of Neurology, Medstar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC, USA|Department of Neurology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA|Departments of Neurology and Population Health, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, USA|Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ, USA|Department of Neurological Sciences, Larner College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VA, USA	('USA', 12)
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Pregnancy: Responding to a Rapidly Evolving Situation	Rasmussen, Sonja A.; Jamieson, Denise J.	As the world confronts coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an illness caused by yet another emerging pathogen (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), obstetric care providers are asking what this means for pregnant women. The global spread has been swift, and many key questions remain. The case-fatality rate for persons cared for in the United States and whether asymptomatic persons transmit the virus are examples of questions that need to be answered to inform public health control measures. There are also unanswered questions specific to pregnant women, such as whether pregnant women are more severely affected and whether intrauterine transmission occurs. Although guidelines for pregnant women from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been rapidly developed based on the best available evidence, additional information is critically needed to inform key decisions, such as whether pregnant health care workers should receive special consideration, whether to temporarily separate infected mothers and their newborns, and whether it is safe for infected women to breastfeed. Some current recommendations are well supported, based largely on what we know from seasonal influenza: patients should avoid contact with ill persons, avoid touching their face, cover coughs and sneezes, wash hands frequently, disinfect contaminated surfaces, and stay home when sick. Prenatal clinics should ensure all pregnant women and their visitors are screened for fever and respiratory symptoms, and symptomatic women should be isolated from well women and required to wear a mask. As the situation with COVID-19 rapidly unfolds, it is critical that obstetricians keep up to date. Corresponding author: Denise J.

Clinical and High-Resolution CT Features of the COVID-19 Infection: Comparison of the Initial and Follow-up Changes	Xiong, Y.; Sun, D.; Liu, Y.; Fan, Y.; Zhao, L.; Li, X.; Zhu, W.	OBJECTIVES: In late December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China was caused by a novel coronavirus, newly named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to quantify severity of COVID-19 infection on High-Resolution CT and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From Jan 11, 2020, to Feb 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory and HRCT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five (83%) patients exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips and air bronchograms, compared to initial CT (all p<0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R=0.68, p<0.01). The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (R range 0.36-0.75, p<0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (p=0.001-0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually presented with typical ground-grass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements. Follow-up CT images often demonstrated progressions during the early stage from illness onset.	2020	NA	Investigative radiology	NA	NA	NA	32134800	10.1097/rli.0000000000000674	5618	#5341	Xiong 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1097/rli.0000000000000674	Departments of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China	('China', 1)

After China, Italy is the country with the highest number of cases so far (41,035 confirmed cases according to Dipartimento della Protezione Civile as of March 19, and 3,405 deaths). In Northern Italy, where the current prevalence of confirmed cases has surpassed in some areas 2 per 1,000 people, kidney transplant patients are getting infected and starting to develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).	2020	NA	American Journal of Transplantation	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/ajt.15891	21134	#20868	Gandolfini 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/ajt.15891	Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Parma, UO Nefrologia, Azienda Ospedaliera‐Universitaria Parma, Parma, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0715-6764 Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Parma, UO Nefrologia, Azienda Ospedaliera‐Universitaria Parma, Parma, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Parma, UO Nefrologia, Azienda Ospedaliera‐Universitaria Parma, Parma, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|Renal Unit, Department of Medicine, University Hospital of Verona, Verona, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Parma, UO Nefrologia, Azienda Ospedaliera‐Universitaria Parma, Parma, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|UO Malattie Infettive, Azienda Ospedaliera‐Universitaria Parma, Parma, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|Pediatric Nephrology Unit, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, Città della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7636-3196 Renal Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USASearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7837-0923 Renal Division, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USASearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7468-9600 Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Parma, UO Nefrologia, Azienda Ospedaliera‐Universitaria Parma, Parma, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Parma, UO Nefrologia, Azienda Ospedaliera‐Universitaria Parma, Parma, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0715-6764 Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Parma, UO Nefrologia, Azienda Ospedaliera‐Universitaria Parma, Parma, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Parma, UO Nefrologia, Azienda Ospedaliera‐Universitaria Parma, Parma, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|Renal Unit, Department of Medicine, University Hospital of Verona, Verona, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Parma, UO Nefrologia, Azienda Ospedaliera‐Universitaria Parma, Parma, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|UO Malattie Infettive, Azienda Ospedaliera‐Universitaria Parma, Parma, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|Pediatric Nephrology Unit, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, Città della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7636-3196 Renal Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USASearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7837-0923 Renal Division, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USASearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7468-9600 Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Parma, UO Nefrologia, Azienda Ospedaliera‐Universitaria Parma, Parma, ItalySearch for more papers by this author 	('Italy', 16)|('USA', 4)
Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19): Emergence and implications for emergency care	Yee, Jane; Unger, Lucy; Zadravecz, Frank; Cariello, Paloma; Seibert, Allan; Johnson, Michael Austin; Fuller, Matthew Joseph	Abstract A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) causing acute illness with severe symptoms has been isolated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Since its emergence, cases have been found worldwide, reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks over the past 2 decades. Current understanding of this epidemic remains limited due to its rapid development and available data. While occurrence outside mainland China remains low, the likelihood of increasing cases globally continues to rise. Given this potential, it is imperative that emergency clinicians understand the preliminary data behind the dynamics of this disease, recognize possible presentations of patients, and understand proposed treatment modalities.	2020	NA	Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians Open	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/emp2.12034	264	#1442	Yee 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology	10.1002/emp2.12034	Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USASearch for more papers by this author|Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USASearch for more papers by this author|Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USASearch for more papers by this author|Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USASearch for more papers by this author|Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USASearch for more papers by this author|Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USASearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: matthew.fuller@hsc.utah.edu  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2880-5463 Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA Correspondence Matthew Joseph Fuller, MD, Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, 30 N 1900 E, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA.

Contracting and Reporting Conservatism around a Change in Fiduciary Duties	Bens, Daniel; Huang, Sterling; Tan, Liang; Wongsunwai, Wan	ABSTRACT We exploit an influential 1991 Delaware court ruling to examine simultaneously two types of conservatism that play important roles in resolving creditor-owner agency conflicts: contracting conservatism and reporting conservatism. The ruling expanded managerial fiduciary duties in favor of creditors for Delaware-incorporated firms in the vicinity of insolvency. In those firms, following the ruling, debt contracts are less likely to include conservative adjustments to accounting numbers used for covenant compliance (i.e., contracting conservatism decreases), while public financial reporting becomes more conservative (i.e., reporting conservatism increases). The decrease in contracting conservatism is concentrated in firms that exhibit a greater increase in reporting conservatism, suggesting that reporting conservatism is more cost effective in resolving agency conflicts. In addition, the substitution effect is more pronounced in firms facing greater business uncertainty and firms with greater board independence. This article is protected by copyright.

Practical considerations in the anaesthetic management of patients during a COVID-19 epidemic	Ong, S.; Tan, T.

We concur with these guidelines, which are not dissimilar to our hospital's protocols since Singapore reported its first case of COVID-19 on 23 January 2020. To date, there have been 226 confirmed cases in Singapore with no deaths reported [2]. We are preparing for many more when community transmission becomes widespread and every patient presenting for surgery becomes a potential asymptomatic infected case. We would like to highlight additional anaesthetic considerations in this COVID-19 pandemic.

Covid-19 and long term conditions: what if you have cancer, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease?	Extance, Andy	When the UK prime minister, live on national TV with the chief medical officer Chris Whitty, advised vulnerable patientsâ€”including those with chronic kidney diseaseâ€”to minimise their social contact, it should have been a welcome surprise for Tess Harris, chief executive of the Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) charity. But recognition of this often unseen group provided no pleasure. Instead, it led to confusion. Chronic kidney disease covers people with a wide range of symptom severity. Those at stage one usually have no obvious symptoms, or possibly blood in their urine. Those with stage five disease, like Harris, have lost nearly all kidney function. Yet Whittyâ€™s comments had people at stage one unnecessarily worried that theyâ€™d have to go into self-isolation, Harris told The BMJ . They were asking whether they should go to work, or let their children go to school, she explains. â€œThatâ€™s been a big challengeâ€”trying to interpret for patients.â€ Harris receives peritoneal dialysis at home. â€œItâ€™s life saving that I get my home dialysis fluids delivered along with everything else I need to stay safe,â€ she explained. Because she has a tube protruding from her stomach, itâ€™s important for her to avoid infection, including maintaining good hand hygiene. Her deliveries come every two weeks, with her most recent arriving two days after Whittyâ€™s announcement. â€œLuckily, there was hand gel,â€ she says. â€œIn two weeksâ€™ time, however, I donâ€™t know.â€ She has a routine appointment on 23 March but doesnâ€™t know if thatâ€™s going ahead. PKD is an inherited condition, meaning that several family members can have it, adding extra complications for self-isolation. As the disease advances, dialysis or a kidney â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1174-m1174	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1174	15886	#15291	Extance 2020	Qingxia Zhong (2020-04-01 00:32:48)(Included): correction added (19480); 	* Opinion piece	10.1136/bmj.m1174	Exeter, UK	('UK', 1)
Initial Cluster of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infections in Wuhan, China Is Consistent with Substantial Human-to-Human Transmission Novel Coronavirus Outbreak in Wuhan, China, 2020: Intense Surveillance Is Vital for Preventing Sustained Transmission in New Locations	Nishiura, Hiroshi; Linton, Natalie M.; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.; Thompson, Robin N.	Reanalysis of the epidemic curve from the initial cluster of cases with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in December 2019 indicates substantial human-to-human transmission. It is possible that the common exposure history at a seafood market in Wuhan originated from the human-to-human transmission events within the market, and the early, strong emphasis that market exposure indicated animal-to-human transmission was potentially the result of observer bias. To support the hypothesis of zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV stemming from the Huanan seafood market, the index case should have had exposure history related to the market and the virus should have been identified from animals sold at the market. As these requirements remain unmet, zoonotic spillover at the market must not be overemphasized. The outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, has generated 24,500 confirmed cases, including 492 deaths, as of 5 February 2020. The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to 24 countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA. Fortunately, there has only been limited human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here, we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected early in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.41 (credible interval [0.27, 0.55]). However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.012 (credible interval [0, 0.099]). This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a global pandemic.	2020	NA	Journal of Clinical Medicine	9	2	NA	NA	10.3390/jcm9020488 10.3390/jcm9020498ER -	568	#667	Nishiura 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.3390/jcm9020488	Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita 15 Jo Nishi 7 Chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo-shi, Hokkaido 060-8638, Japan	('Japan', 1)

Backcalculating the Incidence of Infection with COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess	Nishiura, Hiroshi	To understand the time-dependent risk of infection on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, I estimated the incidence of infection with novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The epidemic curve of a total of 199 confirmed cases was drawn, classifying individuals into passengers with and without close contact and crew members. A backcalculation method was employed to estimate the incidence of infection. The peak time of infection was seen for the time period from 2 to 4 February 2020, and the incidence has abruptly declined afterwards. The estimated number of new infections among passengers without close contact was very small from 5 February on which a movement restriction policy was imposed. Without the intervention from 5 February, it was predicted that the cumulative incidence with and without close contact would have been as large as 1373 (95% CI: 570, 2176) and 766 (95% CI: 587, 946) cases, respectively, while these were kept to be 102 and 47 cases, respectively. Based on an analysis of illness onset data on board, the risk of infection among passengers without close contact was considered to be very limited. Movement restriction greatly reduced the number of infections from 5 February onwards.	2020	NA	J Clin Med	9	3	E657	32121356	10.3390/jcm9030657	3106	#3329	Nishiura 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.3390/jcm9030657	Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita 15 Jo Nishi 7 Chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo-shi, Hokkaido 060-8638, Japan Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST), Japan Science and Technology Agency, Honcho 4-1-8, Kawaguchi, Saitama 332-0012, Japan	('Japan', 3)

Based on an analysis of illness onset data on board, the risk of infection among passengers without close contact was considered to be very limited. Movement restriction greatly reduced the number of infections from 5 February onwards. Previous studies have found evidence of viral interference between seasonal respiratory viruses. Using laboratory-confirmed data from a Utah-based healthcare provider, Intermountain Health Care, we analyzed the time-specific patterns of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A, influenza B, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, and enterovirus circulation from 2004 to 2018, using descriptive methods and wavelet analysis (n = 89,462) on a local level. The results showed that RSV virus dynamics in Utah were the most consistent of any of the viruses studied, and that the other seasonal viruses were generally in synchrony with RSV, except for enterovirus (which mostly occurs late summer to early fall) and influenza A and B during pandemic years.	2020	NA	Journal of Clinical Medicine	9	3	NA	NA	10.3390/jcm9030657 10.3390/v12030275	2556	#2906	Nishiura 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.3390/jcm9030657	Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita 15 Jo Nishi 7 Chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo-shi, Hokkaido 060-8638, Japan Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST), Japan Science and Technology Agency, Honcho 4-1-8, Kawaguchi, Saitama 332-0012, Japan	('Japan', 3)
Covid-19: Why Germanyâ€™s case fatality rate seems so low	Stafford, Ned	Germany has the third highest number of coronavirus cases in Europe, but deaths are relatively few when compared with neighbouring countries. Ned Stafford explains why As the covid-19 pandemic continues to grow in severity, one of the most closely watched statistics has been Germanyâ€™s number of deaths from the virus, which has been remarkably low in comparison with other nations, especially neighbouring European countries. As of 2 April official statistics showed that 872 deaths from covid-19 had been recorded in Germany from 73â€‰522 confirmed cases, translating to a fatality rate of 1.2%.1 This compares with fatality rates of 11.9% in Italy, 9% in Spain, 8.6% in the Netherlands, 8% in the UK, and 7.1% in France.2 Christian Drosten, director of the Institute of Virology at the CharitÃ© hospital in Berlin, believes that Germanyâ€™s relatively low covid-19 fatality rate can be attributed partly to the nationâ€™s early and high level of testing among a wide sample of the German population.

China coronavirus: partial border closures into Hong Kong are not enough, say doctors	Parry, Jane	As the novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV) outbreak rapidly expands across the border in mainland China, healthcare workers in Hong Kong are bracing for a potential explosion of cases locally and have urged the government to severely restrict arrivals from mainland China or even to close the border completely.Eight cases were confirmed in Hong Kong as of 27 January, and 38% of the 663 beds in the negative pressure wards, which are used to isolate patients at public hospitals, were already in use, said officials. They expressed concern that the public health system might be overwhelmed if a local â€œsuper-spreaderâ€ event occurs or by people from mainland China coming into Hong Kong to seek treatment.On 28 January Carrie Lam, Hong Kong chief executive, announced a partial border closure, halting all cross border rail routes from midnight on 30 January, as well as a suspension of six border checkpoints, suspension of ferries, gradual reduction of cross border flights from 480 a â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m349	NA	10.1136/bmj.m349	346	#175	Parry 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1136/bmj.m349	Hamilton, Canada	('Canada', 1)

Pivotal Role of Convalescent Plasma in Managing Emerging Infectious Diseases	Wong, H. K.; Lee, C. K.	Abstract Infectious diseases remain one of the top 10 global health threats as announced by the World Health Organization [1]. The emergence of new pathogens for which there is no effective treatment has redrawn the attention to the usefulness of convalescent plasma. Indeed, convalescent plasma can be an alternate and fast therapeutic option in outbreaks of infectious diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Chikungunya, Ebola and Zika [2-4]. The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has prompted not only a search for effective anti-viral treatment and spread control measures, but also a reconsideration of the use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 treatment [5, 6].	2020	NA	Vox Sanguinis	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/vox.12927	27143	#26728	Wong 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/vox.12927	Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Hong Kong SAR, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: ckleea@ha.org.hk  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3939-564X Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Hong Kong SAR, China Correspondence: CK Lee, Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, 15, King’s Park Rise, Hong Kong SAR, China              E‐mail: ckleea@ha.org.hkSearch for more papers by this author|Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Hong Kong SAR, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: ckleea@ha.org.hk  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3939-564X Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Hong Kong SAR, China Correspondence: CK Lee, Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, 15, King’s Park Rise, Hong Kong SAR, China                    E‐mail: ckleea@ha.org.hkSearch for more papers by this author 	('China', 6)

Phylogenetic analysis of the first four SARS-CoV-2 cases in Chile	Castillo, AndrÃ©s E.; Parra, BÃ¡rbara; Tapia, Paz; Acevedo, Alejandra; Lagos, Jaime; Andrade, Winston; Arata, Loredana; Leal, Gabriel; Barra, Gisselle; Tambley, Carolina; Tognarelli, Javier; Bustos, Patricia; Ulloa, Soledad; Fasce, Rodrigo; FernÃ¡ndez, Jorge	The current pandemic caused by the new coronavirus is a worldwide public health concern. To aboard this emergency, and like never before, scientific groups around the world have been working in a fast and coordinated way in order to get the maximum of information about this virus when it has been almost three months since the first cases were detected in Wuhan province in China. The complete genome sequences of around 450 isolates are available, and studies about similarities and differences among them and with the close related viruses that caused similar epidemics in this century. In this work we studied the complete genome of the first four cases of the new coronavirus disease in Chile, from patients who traveled to Europe and Southeast Asia. Our findings reveal at least two different viral variants entries to Chilean territory, coming from Europe and Asia. We also sub-classified the isolates into variants according to punctual mutations in the genome. Our work contributes to the global information about transmission dynamics and the importance to take control measures to stop the spread of the infection. This article is protected by copyright.

Clinical trial analysis of 2019-nCoV therapy registered in China	Zhang, Qi; Wang, Yakun; Qi, Changsong; Shen, Lin; Li, Jian	Abstract So far, there is a lack of effective drugs for the new coronavirus pneumonia. With more and more patients diagnosed, China has carried out more than one hundred clinical studies of new coronavirus infection, including antiviral drugs, antimalarial drugs, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, virus vaccine and other western drugs, while Chinese medicine researches accounted for half of studies. Most of the trials were initiated by investigators and the study period would last for one to eleven months. The primary endpoints included symptom improvement and virus nucleic acid turning negative, but the optimal endpoint has not been determined. Although the final results of studies will take a long time to complete, the interim research data may provide some help for the current urgent demand for drug treatment. Compared with that of during SARS period in 2003, China have the stronger capability to carry out clinical trials of new drugs in emergency period. This article is protected by copyright.

The 2019â€new coronavirus epidemic: Evidence for virus evolution	Benvenuto, Domenico; Giovanetti, Marta; Ciccozzi, Alessandra; Spoto, Silvia; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo	There is a worldwide concern about the new coronavirus 2019â€nCoV as a global public health threat. In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus. A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequences of 2019â€nCoV, 12 whole genome sequences of 2019â€nCoV, and 12 highly similar whole genome sequences available in gene bank (five from the severe acute respiratory syndrome, two from Middle East respiratory syndrome, and five from bat SARSâ€like coronavirus).

The 2019-new coronavirus epidemic: evidence for virus evolution	Benvenuto, Domenico; Giovannetti, Marta; Ciccozzi, Alessandra; Spoto, Silvia; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo	Abstract There is worldwide concern about the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV as a global public health threat. In thisÂ article,Â we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus. A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequenceÂ of 2019-nCoV and 12 whole genome sequencesÂ of 2019-nCoV and 12 highly similar whole genome sequences available in gene bank (5 from SARS, 2 from MERS and 5 from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus). Fast Unconstrained Bayesian ApproximationÂ (FUBAR) analysis shows that theÂ NucleocapsidÂ and the Spike Glycoprotein have some sites under positive pressure while homology modelling revealed some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019.nCoV significantly clustered with Bat SARS-like Coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in Spike Glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein. From these results, 2019-nCoV could be considered as a coronavirus distinct from SARS virus, probably transmitted from bats or another host where conferred its ability to infect humans.

Work stress among Chinese nurses to support Wuhan for fighting against the COVID-19 epidemic	Mo, Yuanyuan; Deng, Lan; Zhang, Liyan; Lang, Qiuyan; Liao, Chunyan; Wang, Nannan; Qin, Mingqin; Huang, Huiqiao	AIMS: In this study, we aimed to investigate work stress among Chinese nurses that are supporting Wuhan in fighting against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and explore relevant influencing factors. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a major threat to public health. Nurses have always played an important role in infection prevention, infection control, isolation, containment, and public health. However, available data on the work stress among these nurses is limited. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey. An online questionnaire was completed by 180 anti-epidemic nurses from Guangxi. Data collection tools, including the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS) and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Descriptive, single factor, correlation, and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring related influencing factors. RESULTS: The SOS (39.91Â±12.92) and SAS scores (32.19Â±7.56) of this nurse group were positively correlated (r=0.676, p<0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that only children, working hours per week, and anxiety were the main factors affecting nurse stress (p=0.000, 0.048, 0.000, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Nurses who fight against COVID-19 were generally under pressure. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse leaders should pay attention to the work stress and the influencing factors of the nurses who are fighting against COVID-19 infection, and offer solutions to retain mental health among these nurses.	2020	NA	Journal of nursing management	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/jonm.13014	37834	#38431	Mo 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/jonm.13014	https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7031-0870 The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi, Medical University, Nanning, 530007 China These authors contributed equally to this work.Search for more papers by this author|The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi, Medical University, Nanning, 530007 China These authors contributed equally to this work.Search for more papers by this author|The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi, Medical University, Nanning, 530007 ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi, Medical University, Nanning, 530021 ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Affiliated hospital of Guilin, Medical University, Guilin, 541001 ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Liuzhou Worker's Hospital, Liuzhou, 545001 ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: 2026142822@qq.com E-mail address: 820325832@qq.com  The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi, Medical University, Nanning, 530007 China Corresponding Authors MS.

Three children who recovered from novel coronavirus 2019 pneumonia	Lou, Xin Xia; Shi, Cai Xiao; Zhou, Chong Chen; Tian, Yu Sheng	In December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as novel COVIDâ€19, occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.1-5 The disease rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. Previous studies suggest that COVIDâ€19 is more likely to infect older adult men, particularly those with chronic comorbidities.6-8 In the isolation ward of the children's hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, three children were hospitalised with pneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (COVIDâ€19). Two were sisters, aged 6 and 8 years old and one was a 6â€monthâ€old boy. All three patients had fever, and two had nasal congestion and rhinitis, associated with fatigue, diarrhoea and headache. The 6â€yearâ€old girl mainly had cough. None had dyspnoea or cyanosis. Their computerised tomographic scans are shown in Figures 1-3. None of the children required intensive care or mechanical ventilation or had any severe complications.	2020	NA	Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/jpc.14871	12330	#11340	Lou 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/jpc.14871	https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7386-3729 Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Henan Children's Hospital, Zhengzhou, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Henan Children's Hospital, Zhengzhou, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Henan Children's Hospital, Zhengzhou, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Henan Children's Hospital, Zhengzhou, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7386-3729 Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Henan Children's Hospital, Zhengzhou, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Henan Children's Hospital, Zhengzhou, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Henan Children's Hospital, Zhengzhou, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Henan Children's Hospital, Zhengzhou, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author 	('China', 8)
2019 novel coronavirus infection and gastrointestinal tract	Gao, Qin Yan; Chen, Ying Xuan; Fang, Jing Yuan	Since end of December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown origin was reported from Wuhan, Hubei province, China. As of Feb 17th, 2020, statistical data show that the outbreak constitutes an epidemic threat in China, where the exponential increase in patients has reached 75114 confirmed cases, with 2239 deaths. Different from SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infection, the initial presentations or the chief complain of some patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) were gastrointestinal symptoms. So we call upon all the first-line medical staff to be cautious and pay more attention to those untypical patients especially from the epidemic area. Besides, as the viral nucleic acids could be found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients with COVID-19 infection, the possibility of fecal-oral transmission need to be took into account. Based on the previously and recently studies, we speculate that COVID-19 may have some relationship with the gut microbiota through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, thus targeting gut microbiota might be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of virus-related pneumonia.

Clinical findings in a patient with hemophilia A affected by COVID-19	Cui, Dongyan; Zhang, Ai; Liu, Aiguo; Hu, Qun	At the end of 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients were confirmed to be infected with a novel coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. This infectious disease was designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It rapidly spreads throughout the world. More than 80,000 cases have been reported in China and epidemics have grown in other countries.	2020	NA	Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/hae.14000	26610	#27458	Cui 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/hae.14000	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1587-5638 Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: qunhu2013@163.com  Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China Correspondence Qun Hu, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.

Considerations for statin therapy in patients with COVID-19	Dashti-Khavidaki, Simin; Khalili, Hossein	Abstract Current coronavirus pandemic named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus outbreak during the current century after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses.1 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an immunopathologic event and main cause of death following COVID-19. The main mechanism of ARDS is uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response and cytokine storm following release of proinflammatory cytokines (such as interferons (IFN), interleukines (IL), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±) and chemokines.2-3 So, some Chinese researchers proposed or used anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment regimen of patients with COVID-19.3-4	2020	NA	Pharmacotherapy: The Journal of Human Pharmacology and Drug Therapy	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/phar.2397	45187	#42041	Dashti-Khavidaki 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/phar.2397	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2004-7845 Professor of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IranSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: khalilih@sina.tums.ac.ir  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1590-6396 Professor of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran Corresponding Author: Hossein Khalili Professor of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, P.O.Box: 1417614411 E‐mail: khalilih@sina.tums.ac.irSearch for more papers by this author|https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2004-7845 Professor of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IranSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: khalilih@sina.tums.ac.ir  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1590-6396 Professor of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran Corresponding Author: Hossein Khalili Professor of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, P.O.Box: 1417614411 E‐mail: khalilih@sina.tums.ac.irSearch for more papers by this author 	('Iran', 6)
Clare Gerada: Doctors on the covid-19 front line also need to protect themselves and their colleagues	Gerada, Clare	I brought more than a fridge magnet back from my recent trip to New York. Unbeknown to me, I also brought back covid-19. I confused the initial symptoms of fatigue with jet lag. I thought that the dry cough was secondary to the effects of the cabin air. However, it was quite clear that a high temperature wasnâ€™t a symptom of jet lag, and very soon after arriving back in the UK I realised that Iâ€™d developed the illness thatâ€™s been on everyoneâ€™s mind for weeks. The NHS was still routinely testing, although in the community this was only for people who had returned from a list of countries deemed to be high risk.

Editorial 58(1)	Abernethy, Katharine	As I write, the world is gripped by news of a novel coronavirus sweeping across the planet. The epidemic is causing terrible anguish to many thousands of families and astounding economic damage in Asia. Whilst yet unconfirmed, several research results now point at the hunting, trade and consumption of pangolins as a likely source of the epidemic. Whether or not pangolins do finally prove to be at the origin of this particular virus, the research highlights that the possibility is very real. This may turn out to be a turning point for pangolin conservation, perhaps for the conservation of a great many other species. In 2015, the IUCN Species Survival Commission Pangolin Specialist Group reported concerns that the profound decline in Asian pangolins would lead to traffickers procuring supplies from Africa. The next five years saw their predictions largely fulfilled. Robust results from a range of research approaches showed first an increase in trade and value of pangolins within the West and central Africa and, more recently, growing international trafficking, with China and Vietnam as major destinations. In 2016, the CITES 17th Conference of Parties moved all African pangolin species onto Appendix 1. Not a single research paper published on pangolins in the past 5 years has suggested anything other than desperate jeopardy for all eight of the worldâ€™s species. All available researches point to increasing harvesting, with the rise ultimately driven by trade for profit. The plight of overâ€hunted pangolins has become a rallying call for conservation over the past few years. New NGO and government funding initiatives have arisen, dedicated to research for their conservation. The dramatically steep decline of the Asian species has been written about in both Science and Nature, the most widely read scientific journals of the day, in the last few years. The pangolin, alongside the elephant, is a poster species for action against the illegal wildlife trade. However, the research communityâ€™s awareness of the impending doom has not in the least stemmed the trade. This issue contains a Short Communication reporting for the first time trade in pangolins in yet another country, South Sudan. I am unsure of what the public response to the possibility that pangolins can transmit deadly viruses will be. I hope it is to leave them alone, rather than to try to eradicate them. This Journal remains committed to improving knowledge of the African ecosystems and increasingly to reporting research that shows how they are changing in the face of our actions. This issue, as each issue, makes a new and relevant contribution to that objective.	2020	NA	African Journal of Ecology	58	1	1-Jan	NA	10.1111/aje.12732	3171	#3469	Abernethy 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Reservoir	10.1111/aje.12732	Institut de Recherche en Ecologie Tropicale, Libreville, Gabon|Institut de Recherche en Ecologie Tropicale, Libreville, Gabon	('Gabon', 2)

Die Anwendung der Traditionellen Chinesischen Medizin (TCM)/Akupunktur in der Therapie und PrÃ¤vention von SARS-CoV-2-Infektionen	Fleckenstein, Johannes; FÃ¼zeki, Eszter; Banzer, Winfried	GegenwÃ¤rtig kursieren zahlreiche VorschlÃ¤ge zur potenziellen Wirksamkeit von Traditioneller Chinesischer Medizin (TCM)/Akupunktur in der Therapie von SARS-CoV-2-Infektionen und assoziierten Symptomen. Stand dieser Ãœberlegungen sind insbesondere molekularvirologische, aber auch klinische Untersuchungen aus der SARS-Epidemie 2002/2003. Ein Wirksamkeitsnachweis von chinesischen Arzneimitteln mit antiviralem Potenzial in Bezug auf SARS-CoVâ€‘2 steht grÃ¶ÃŸtenteils aus. Klinische Daten stÃ¼tzen sich nahezu ausschlieÃŸlich auf Studien vor Beginn der Coronapandemie. GegenwÃ¤rtig finden sich nur international publizierte Fallberichte sowie in China berichtete Beobachtungsstudien. Vielversprechend ist eine groÃŸe Zahl registrierter prospektiver Studien, die gegenwÃ¤rtig durchgefÃ¼hrt werden. Die Evidenzlage fÃ¼r die nichtpharmakologischen TherapiesÃ¤ulen der TCM ist sehr schwach.

Transcriptomic characteristics of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in COVID-19 patients	Xiong, Yong; Liu, Yuan; Cao, Liu; Wang, Dehe; Guo, Ming; Jiang, Ao; Guo, Dong; Hu, Wenjia; Yang, Jiayi; Tang, Zhidong; Wu, Honglong; Lin, Yongquan; Zhang, Meiyuan; Zhang, Qi; Shi, Mang; Liu, Yingle; Zhou, Yu; Lan, Ke; Chen, Yu	Circulating in China and 158 other countries and areas, the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has caused devastating mortality and posed a great threat to public health. However, efforts to identify effectively supportive therapeutic drugs and treatments has been hampered by our limited understanding of host immune response for this fatal disease. To characterize the transcriptional signatures of host inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19) infection, we carried out transcriptome sequencing of the RNAs isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) specimens of COVID-19 patients. Our results reveal distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients, and highlight the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release such as CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1A, and CCL4/MIP1B. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 induced activation of apoptosis and P53 signalling pathway in lymphocytes may be the cause of patients' lymphopenia. The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients would be a valuable resource for clinical guidance on anti-inflammatory medication and understanding the molecular mechansims of host response.	2020	NA	Emerg Microbes Infect	NA	NA	NA	32228226	10.1080/22221751.2020.1747363	27295	#29222	Xiong 2020	NA	NA	10.1080/22221751.2020.1747363	Institute B.

Seattleâ€™s covid-19 lessons are yielding hope	Nelson, Bryn	The far north western corner of the continental US was hit early and hard. Bryn Nelson reports that the region now appears to be successfully climbing its way out of the epidemic Everything changed in Seattle on 28 February 2020. The metropolitan region of about 3.5 million people in Washington State had already documented the first US case of covid-19 on 20 January in a 35 year old man who had visited his family in Wuhan, China. The patient tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was immediately hospitalised in an isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington.1 After treatment with remdesivir, the man was released on 3 February. Tracing and monitoring (but not testing) of nearly 70 potential contacts didnâ€™t turn up any signs of covid-19, and state health officials breathed a wary sigh of relief. On 28 February the discovery of two new presumptive cases was announced. The first, a woman in her 50s, had recently returned from South Korea.2 The second, a high school student from a suburb north of Seattle, was identified serendipitously through a research project called the Seattle Flu Study that had shifted course to test for coronavirus.3 The student had no known links to other cases, making him the first apparent case of community covid-19 transmission in the US. The same day, officials at EvergreenHealth hospital in Kirkland, a suburb east of Seattle, dropped another bombshell. The hospitalâ€™s infection control team had grown suspicious of two cases in the intensive care unit and sent swab samples to the state laboratory.

Budgeting for covid-19: changing the narrative and narrating the change	Cowper, Andy	The UK governmentâ€™s plan for dealing with covid-19 has now moved from the â€œcontainâ€ phase to the â€œdelayâ€ stage.1 This is just a recognition of reality. The World Health Organization has confirmed that the outbreak is now a pandemic,2 and the spread of disease is moving as expected.3 The move to the â€œdelayâ€ phase raises the question of what an effective UK reaction to pandemic covid-19 is going to look like, other than to buy us some preparation time. ITVâ€™s political editor Robert Peston has a close working relationship with sources inside Boris Johnsonâ€™s government, and his latest blog outlines the governmentâ€™s â€œherd immunityâ€ strategy.4 It is worth quoting: â€œThe strategy of the British government in minimising the impact . . . is to allow the virus to pass through the entire population so that we acquire herd immunity, but at a much delayed speed so that those who suffer the most acute symptoms are able to receive the medical support they need, and such that the â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1053-m1053	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1053	8833	#8367	Cowper 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Ethics, social science, economics	10.1136/bmj.m1053	Institute for Fiscal Studies.

2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic: Built Environment Considerations To Reduce Transmission	Dietz, Leslie; Horve, Patrick F.; Coil, David A.; Fretz, Mark; Eisen, Jonathan A.; Van Den Wymelenberg, Kevin	<p>With the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that results in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), corporate entities, federal, state, county, and city governments, universities, school districts, places of worship, prisons, health care facilities, assisted living organizations, daycares, homeowners, and other building owners and occupants have an opportunity to reduce the potential for transmission through built environment (BE)-mediated pathways. Over the last decade, substantial research into the presence, abundance, diversity, function, and transmission of microbes in the BE has taken place and revealed common pathogen exchange pathways and mechanisms. In this paper, we synthesize this microbiology of the BE research and the known information about SARS-CoV-2 to provide actionable and achievable guidance to BE decision makers, building operators, and all indoor occupants attempting to minimize infectious disease transmission through environmentally mediated pathways. We believe this information is useful to corporate and public administrators and individuals responsible for building operations and environmental services in their decision-making process about the degree and duration of social-distancing measures during viral epidemics and pandemics.</p>	2020	NA	mSystems	5	2	NA	NA	10.1128/mSystems.00245-20	37732	#38345	Dietz 2020	NA	NA	10.1128/mSystems.00245-20	Institute for Health and the Built Environment, University of Oregon, Portland, Oregon, USA|Department of Evolution and Ecology, University of California‚ÄîDavis, Davis, California, USA|Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of California‚ÄîDavis, Davis, California, USA|Institute for Health and the Built Environment, University of Oregon, Portland, Oregon, USA|University of California San Diego|Institute of Environmental Sciences and Technology|Institute of Environmental Sciences and Technology	('USA', 4)
Coronaviruses in animals and humans	Ng, Lisa F. P.; Hiscox, Julian A.	Controlling outbreaks will require detailed knowledge of their biology and behaviourCoronaviruses have been around for many years and were first discovered in the 1960s. They include viruses contributing to the common cold (HCoV-229E) and a variety of animal and avian coronaviruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which infects poultry. Coronaviruses typically cause respiratory or gastrointestinal illness, but strains of IBV have been shown to target the oviduct in chickens, and others can cause severe kidney disease.Animal and avian coronaviruses can have high mortality rates among infected animals and illustrate the difficulties in developing vaccines. Similar to influenza viruses, despite many decades of research there is no vaccine that protects against all strains of IBV coronavirus. This is due in part to the continuously shifting diversity in the virus spike glycoprotein, a major immunogenic target and hence a good vaccine candidate for animal and human infections.During the mid-1990s these viruses were described as the backwater of virology, since none caused serious disease in humans.

Europeâ€™s migrant containment policies threaten the response to covid-19	Hargreaves, Sally; Kumar, Bernadette N.; McKee, Martin; Jones, Lucy; Veizis, Apostolos	Policy makers must include migrant camps in their national plans The world has watched the growing global health crisis caused by covid-19 with alarm, fear, and desperation. One after another, governments, healthcare systems, and individuals are adopting increasingly restrictive measures, with â€œsocial distancingâ€ now the norm in most countries. Yet for many people, and especially migrants who have been displaced from their homes, this is not possible. Several tens of thousands of people are living in migrant camps around the Mediterranean. These are often run well beyond capacity and in suboptimal conditions, including lack of basic infrastructure or hygiene, making them a high risk environment for coronavirus spread. MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) has called on the Greek government to immediately evacuate its camps, particularly older people and those with chronic diseases, so far without response.1 People held in immigration detention centres are also affected. Demands from 10 refugee and detention charities for UK detainees to be released on public health grounds have been ignored.2 And there are thousands of migrants forcibly detained along the north African coast, intercepted en route to Europe, living in appalling conditions and lacking food, â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1213-m1213	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1213	16609	#15930	Hargreaves 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Ethics, social science, economics	10.1136/bmj.m1213	Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George‚Äôs University of London, London, UK|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care Medicine	('UK', 1)

Breastfeeding and Coronavirus Disease-2019. Ad interim indications of the Italian Society of Neonatology endorsed by the Union of European Neonatal & Perinatal Societies	Davanzo, Riccardo; Moro, Guido; Sandri, Fabrizio; Agosti, Massimo; Moretti, Corrado; Mosca, Fabio	The recent COVID-19 pandemic has spread to Italy with heavy consequences on public health and economics. Besides the possible consequences of COVID-19 infection on a pregnant woman and the fetus, a major concern is related to the potential effect on neonatal outcome, the appropriate management of the mother-newborn dyad and finally the compatibility of maternal COVID-19 infection with breastfeeding. The Italian Society on Neonatology (SIN) after reviewing the limited scientific knowledge on the compatibility of breastfeeding in the COVID-19 mother and the available statements from Health Care Organizations, has issued the following indications that have been endorsed by the Union of European Neonatal & Perinatal Societies (UENPS). If a mother previously identified as COVID-19 positive or under investigation for COVID-19 is asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic at delivery, rooming-in is feasible and direct breastfeeding is advisable, under strict measures of infection control. On the contrary, when a mother with COVID-19 is too sick to care for the newborn, the neonate will be managed separately and fed fresh expressed breast milk, with no need to pasteurize it, as human milk is not believed to be a vehicle of COVID-19. We recognize that this guidance might be subject to change in the future when further knowledge will be acquired about the COVID-19 pandemic, the perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and clinical characteristics of cases of neonatal COVID-19.	2020	NA	Maternal & child nutrition	NA	NA	e13010-e13010	NA	10.1111/mcn.13010	31036	#31637	Davanzo 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/mcn.13010	Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS ‚ÄúBurlo Garofolo‚Äù, Trieste|Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS ‚ÄúBurlo Garofolo‚Äù, Trieste	NA

Machine Learning, COVID-19 (2019-nCoV), and multi-OMICS	TÃ¡rnok, Attila	The primary plan of my editorial for this month was to highlight and comment on the special issue of this month: â€œMachine Learning for Single Cell Dataâ€. I wish to emphasize and thank the Guest Editors of this special issue, Yvan Saeys and Greg Finak, for their outstanding success and hard work to assemble excellent manuscripts for this issue. I am referring to their guest editorial giving you more details on aims and scopes and elaborating on specific articles. I started drafting this editorial while attending the annual Photonics West conference in San Francisco, presumably the largest showcase on photonics technologies and instrumentation. Scientifically, the subâ€conference BIOS demonstrated the broadness and vividness of photonics technologies in life sciences and particularly in single cell analysis. When searching for relevant literature for this editorial, I was also tracking the actual global developments. This brought me to change my focus and comment on some issues that are relevant to our field and somewhat related to that of the special issue. First of all, Nature Methods announced their Method of the Year 2019 1. It is: â€œSingleâ€cell multimodal omicsâ€ and acknowledges (among others) the important contribution of highly multiplexed flow cytometry and cell sorting to the increased understanding of single cell biology and cell systems. This is motivating and confirms that cytometry is receiving the focus of attention. Concurrently, in the last weeks the relevance of the recent COVIDâ€19 (2019â€nCoV) outbreak and its effects started to become evident as everybody was monitoring the number of cases registered globally 2. As conference chairs, we were facing the fact that many of our speakers and colleagues became unavailable. Not only that, but the eeriness of the infection (it is transmissible already during its asymptomatic latency period of up to two weeks, recent results indicate even longer) gave many attendees an uneasy feeling. This brings me to two points worth discussing. (a) Are large scale conferences with global attendance still state of the art or should they be rethought; and (b) to what extent can cytometry support global efforts in various fields of epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases? In the past one to two decades the world faced several outbreaks of different viral infections that were luckily not as disastrous as initially anticipated but still claimed victims. These were coronaviruses such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARSâ€CoV) in 2002/2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERSâ€CoV) with occasional outbreaks since 2012 or influenza viruses like the H1N1 pandemic in 2009/2010. It is only a matter of time until other pandemics follow. Global travel for work and leisure supports viral spread and can transport the infection to nearly all places of the globe within days. Global conferences contribute to such a rapid spread and one should reconsider this model of scientific exchange from time to time and scrutinize potential alternatives. Models for sustainable international conferences are under testing and combine venues in close proximity to institutions with a substantial expertise on the focus area of the conference with virtual participation and contribution by internet for participants on more distant places. Although personal meetings are essential for optimal information exchange, a reduction in travel would not only reduce the risk of dissemination of disease but, as a side effect, could result in budgetary savings, reduce travelâ€related emissions (in the wake of Greta), and eliminate jetlag. Now, what can Cytometry do for help in pandemics? Cytometry has already supported several achievements as a quick and nonâ€representative literature search shows. Image cytometry methods 3 and beadâ€based flow cytometry methods 4 are at hand to enable for screening and detecting antibody virus interactions and detect viral antigens. Airway memory Tâ€cells and viral E protein mutations have been identified in CoV infections a potential targets for vaccine strategies 5, 6. Immune responses seem to be indicative of disease severity 6, 7 but more studies are needed to have a practical assay for decision making at hand. In fact, easy to use and rapid assays derived from Cytomics or multiâ€OMICS approaches are needed to rapidly distinguish severe from mild cases and identify future critically ill individuals before symptom onset. Such a test would clearly take the pressure off of the clinicians because only those with high probability to becoming critically ill would receive intensive care early. Hopefully we will see more related studies in this journal in the near future.	2020	NA	Cytometry Part A	97	3	215-216	NA	10.1002/cyto.a.23990	5020	#5479	TÃ¡rnok 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1002/cyto.a.23990	Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology (IMISE), University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany|Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology (IMISE), University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany	('Germany', 2)
Health surveillance during covid-19 pandemic	Calvo, Rafael A.; Deterding, Sebastian; Ryan, Richard M.	How to safeguard autonomy and why it mattersSocieties are responding to the covid-19 pandemic at breathtaking speed. Many of these ad hoc responses will have long lasting consequences, and we must make sure that todayâ€™s efforts do not threaten our future wellbeing.The most consequential transformations may come from new health surveillance technologies that use machine learning and automated decision making to parse peopleâ€™s digital footprints, identify those who are potentially infected, trace their contacts, and enforce social distancing. Some have argued that such digital contact tracing could be more effective in controlling the epidemic than mass quarantine.1The Israeli government, for example, authorised the repurposing of an anti-terror phone tracking programme, trawling the location histories of its whole population to monitor and enforce self-isolation of people who tested positive. Israelâ€™s health ministry has since launched a mobile app allowing citizens to check whether they have crossed paths with anyone infected and need to self-isolate.2In China, two big providers of mobile payment â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	369	NA	m1373-m1373	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1373	34262	#35041	Calvo 2020	NA	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1373	Institute for Positive Psychology and Education, Australian Catholic University, Sydney, Australia|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care Medicine	('Australia', 2)
Aggregated mobility data could help fight COVID-19	Buckee, Caroline O.; Balsari, Satchit; Chan, Jennifer; Crosas, MercÃ¨; Dominici, Francesca; Gasser, Urs; Grad, Yonatan H.; Grenfell, Bryan; Halloran, M.

The research and public health response communities can and should use population mobility data collected by private companies, with appropriate legal, organizational, and computational safeguards in place. When aggregated, these data can help refine interventions by providing near real-time information about changes in patterns of human movement.	2020	NA	Science	NA	NA	eabb8021	NA	10.1126/science.abb8021	14791	#14079	Buckee 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Ethics, social science, economics	10.1126/science.abb8021	Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Harvard University, Boston, MA 02138, USA.|University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.|Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SZ, UK.|Department of Biological Sciences and Eck Institute for Global Health, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.|Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.|Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Harvard University, Boston, MA 02138, USA.|University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.|Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SZ, UK.|Department of Biological Sciences and Eck Institute for Global Health, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA.|Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.|Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.

Mesenchymal stem cell infusion shows promise for combating coronavirus (COVID-19)-induced pneumonia	Shetty, A. K.	A new study published by the journal Aging & Disease reported that intravenous administration of clinical-grade human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in improved functional outcomes (Leng et al., Aging Dis, 11:216-228, 2020). This study demonstrated that intravenous infusion of MSCs is a safe and effective approach for treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including elderly patients displaying severe pneumonia. COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, treating COVID-19 patients, particularly those afflicted with severe pneumonia, is challenging as no specific drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are available. Therefore, MSC therapy inhibiting the overactivation of the immune system and promoting endogenous repair by improving the lung microenvironment after the SARS-CoV-2 infection found in this study is striking. Additional studies in a larger cohort of patients are needed to validate this therapeutic intervention further, however.	2020	NA	Aging and Disease	11	2	462-464	NA	10.14336/AD.2020.0301	44797	#42321	Shetty 2020	NA	NA	10.14336/AD.2020.0301	Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Department of Molecular and Cellular Medicine, Texas A&M University College of Medicine, College Station, Texas, USA	('USA', 1)
Development of epitope-based peptide vaccine against novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-COV-2): Immunoinformatics approach	Bhattacharya, Manojit; Ranjan Sharma, Ashish; Patra, Prasanta; Ghosh, Pratik; Sharma, Garima; Chandra Patra, Bidhan; Lee, Sang-Soo; Chakraborty, Chiranjib	ABSTRACT Recently, a novel Coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) emerged which is responsible for the recent outbreak in Wuhan, China. Genetically, it is closely related to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The situation is getting worse and worse, therefore, there is an urgent need for designing a suitable peptide vaccine component against the SARS-COV-2. Here, we characterized spike glycoprotein to obtain immunogenic epitopes. Next, we chose 13 Major Histocompatibility Complex-(MHC) I and 3 MHC-II epitopes, having antigenic properties. These epitopes are usually linked to specific linkers to build vaccine components and molecularly dock on Toll-Like Receptor (TLR)-5 to get binding affinity. Therefore, in order to provide a fast immunogenic profile of these epitopes we performed immunoinformatics analysis so that rapid development of vaccine might bring this disastrous situation to the end earlier.

Effective containment explains subexponential growth in recent confirmed COVID-19 cases in China	Maier, Benjamin F.; Brockmann, Dirk	The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China was characterized by a distinctive subexponential increase of confirmed cases during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak. We show that this effect can be explained as a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end, we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population-wide isolation practices in response to containment policies or behavioral changes and show that the model captures the observed growth behavior accurately. The insights provided here may aid the careful implementation of containment strategies for ongoing secondary outbreaks of COVID-19 or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.	2020	NA	Science	NA	NA	eabb4557	NA	10.1126/science.abb4557	53739	#45713	Maier 2020	NA	NA	10.1126/science.abb4557	Institute for Theoretical Biology, Humboldt-University of Berlin, Philippstr. 13, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.|Institute for Theoretical Biology, Humboldt-University of Berlin, Philippstr. 13, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.

Can Chinese Medicine Be Used for Prevention of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)? A Review of Historical Classics, Research Evidence and Current Prevention Programs Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody	Luo, H.; Tang, Q. L.; Shang, Y. X.; Liang, S. B.; Yang, M.; Robinson, N.; Liu, J. P.; Tian, X.; Li, C.; Huang, A.; Xia, S.; Lu, S.; Shi, Z.; Lu, L.; Jiang, S.; Yang, Z.; Wu, Y.; Ying, T.	OBJECTIVE: Since December 2019, an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to almost all parts of China. This was followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for the prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed ancient classics and human studies. METHODS: Historical records on prevention and treatment of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases. RESULTS: The use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded. There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza. None of the participants who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.52; n=4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao). CONCLUSIONS: Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population. Prospective, rigorous population studies are warranted to confirm the potential preventive effect of CM. The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 11,900 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health. Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.	2020	NA	Chinese journal of integrative medicine Emerging microbes & infections	9	1	382-385	32065055	10.1007/s11655-020-3192-6 10.1080/22221751.2020.1729069	13842	#12603	Luo 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Other related diseases and viruses	10.1007/s11655-020-3192-6	Institute for Tibetan Medicine, China Tibetology Research Center, Beijing, 100101, China|Institute of Integrated Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510120, China	('China', 3)

A critical COVID metric: your ED staff infection rate	McLean, Samuel	If you're like me, in recent days you've experienced moments of fear. Feelings like when you woke up in bed at night as a kid, and saw a dark shadow in the corner, and wondered if it was going to get you. If you're like me, in recent days you've also experienced awe at so many triumphs over such fear, individual and collective - our 65 year old ED clerk showing up to their shift, through great anxiety, or healthcare providers boarding buses heading into the teeth of the Wuhan epidemic. The pages of AEM this month provide further examples of such triumphs, of individuals in a time and place of great stress overcoming the impulse to curl up and focus on themselves, and instead expanding beyond themselves to help others. This is the finest tradition of humanity and medicine, and all of these efforts at service through science inspire and give heart.	2020	NA	Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1111/acem.13974	19076	#19540	McLean 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Ethics, social science, economics	10.1111/acem.13974	Institute for Trauma Recovery, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC|Institute for Trauma Recovery, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC	NA

Inactivation of three emerging viruses - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus and Nipah virus - in platelet concentrates by ultraviolet C light and in plasma by methylene blue plus visible light	Eickmann, Markus; Gravemann, Ute; Handke, Wiebke; Tolksdorf, Frank; Reichenberg, Stefan; Mueller, Thomas H.; Seltsam, Axel	Background Emerging viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and Nipah virus (NiV) have been identified to pose a potential threat to transfusion safety. In this study, the ability of the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets and THERAFLEX MB-Plasma pathogen inactivation systems to inactivate these viruses in platelet concentrates and plasma, respectively, was investigated. Materials and methods Blood products were spiked with SARS-CoV, CCHFV or NiV, and then treated with increasing doses of UVC light (THERAFLEX UV-Platelets) or with methylene blue (MB) plus increasing doses of visible light (MB/light; THERAFLEX MB-Plasma). Samples were taken before and after treatment with each illumination dose and tested for residual infectivity. Results Treatment with half to three-fourths of the full UVC dose (0 center dot 2 J/cm(2)) reduced the infectivity of SARS-CoV (>= 3 center dot 4 log), CCHFV (>= 2 center dot 2 log) and NiV (>= 4 center dot 3 log) to the limit of detection (LOD) in platelet concentrates, and treatment with MB and a fourth of the full light dose (120 J/cm(2)) decreased that of SARS-CoV (>= 3 center dot 1 log), CCHFV (>= 3 center dot 2 log) and NiV (>= 2 center dot 7 log) to the LOD in plasma. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that both THERAFLEX UV-Platelets (UVC) and THERAFLEX MB-Plasma (MB/light) effectively reduce the infectivity of SARS-CoV, CCHFV and NiV in platelet concentrates and plasma, respectively.	2020	NA	Vox Sanguinis	NA	NA	NA	WOS:000506646700001	10.1111/vox.12888	4510	#4078	Eickmann 2020	NA	Infection prevention and control; Other related diseases and viruses	10.1111/vox.12888	Institute for Virology, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg, Germany|Institute for Virology, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg, Germany	('Germany', 2)

2019 Novel coronavirus: where we are and what we know	Cheng, Zhangkai J.; Shan, Jing	There is a current worldwide outbreak of a new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 17 other countries. Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency. At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities. This information should include reports from outbreak sites and from laboratories supporting the investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates the virology, epidemiology, clinical management strategies from both English and Chinese literature, official news channels, and other official government documents. In addition, by fitting the number of infections with a single-term exponential model, we report that the infection is spreading at an exponential rate, with a doubling period of 1.8Â days.	2020	NA	Infection	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s15010-020-01401-y	59	#1221	Cheng 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology; Virology, immunology	10.1007/s15010-020-01401-y	Institute of Allergy and Immunology, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China|Institute of Medical Physics, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia	('China', 1)|('Australia', 1)

Covid-19: why is the UK government ignoring WHOâ€™s advice?	Pollock, Allyson M.; Roderick, Peter; Cheng, K. K.; Pankhania, Bharat	Testing and tracing must resume urgently On 24 February, there were nine confirmed cases of covid-19 in the UK. On the same day, the World Health Organization recommended countries outside China with imported cases or outbreaks â€œprioritize active, exhaustive case finding and immediate testing and isolation, painstaking contact tracing and rigorous quarantine of close contacts.â€1 On 22 Marchâ€”when there were 5683 confirmed UK casesâ€”Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies programme, repeated the message on the BBC: â€œWhat we really need to focus on is finding those who are sick, those who have the virus, and isolate them, find their contacts and isolate them.â€ This is entirely unexceptional. Case finding, contact tracing and testing, and strict quarantine are the classic tools in public health to control infectious diseases. WHO says they have been painstakingly adopted in China, with a high percentage of identified close contacts completing medical observation. In Singapore, Vietnam, and South Korea meticulous contact tracing combined with clinical observation plus testing were vital in containing the disease.

Covid-19: risk factors for severe disease and death	Jordan, Rachel E.; Adab, Peymane; Cheng, K. K.	A long list is emerging from largely unadjusted analyses, with age near the top As the covid-19 pandemic accelerates, governments are warning people at high risk to be particularly stringent in observing social distancing measures because if they become ill they are more likely to need critical care including ventilation, and to die.1 Most data on covid-19 are from China, and although most confirmed cases have been classified as mild or moderate, 14% are severe and 5% critical.2 Case fatality rates are difficult to assess with certainty but could be as high as 1%,34 which is much greater than seasonal influenza at about 0.1%. Up to 25% of people in the United Kingdom are designated high riskâ€”including all adults aged over 70 and those with underlying health conditions such as respiratory and cardiovascular disease, and cancer.5 Strict restrictions are now in place for everyone, reducing movement outside the home to an absolute minimum, except for essential workers.6 These measures will be in place for weeks, possibly â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1198-m1198	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1198	16621	#15924	Jordan 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.1136/bmj.m1198	Institute of Applied Health Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care Medicine	('UK', 1)

Preventing and reversing the cytokine storm may be the key to save the patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. This study aims to investigate whether MSC transplantation improves the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital, China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 16, 2020. The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection. MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes of seven patients without observed adverse effects. The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation. Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment. After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days. In addition, a group of CD14+CD11c+CD11b(mid) regulatory DC cell population dramatically increased. Meanwhile, the level of TNF-alpha was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2(-) and TMPRSS2(-) which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.	2020	NA	Aging Dis	NA	NA	NA	32257537	10.14336/AD.2020.0228	50430	#45539	Leng 2020	NA	NA	10.14336/AD.2020.0228	Institute of Basic Medical Sciences Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Basic Medicine Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.|Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.|Department of Orthopaedics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.|Institute of Stem Cell and Regeneration Medicine, School of Basic Medicine, Qingdao University, Shandong, China.|Department of Orthopaedics, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University, Xi‚Äôan, China.|Department of Neurosurgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.|Institute of Chinese Medical Science, University of Macau, Taipa, Macau, China.|Institute of Biology, Komi Science Center of Russian Academy of Sciences, Syktyvkar, Russia.|Department of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain.|Department of Biological Sciences, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea.|Department of Biomedicine, Neuroscience and Advanced Diagnostics, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.|University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX76107, USA.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein favors ACE2 from Bovidae and Cricetidae	Luan, Junwen; Jin, Xiaolu; Lu, Yue; Zhang, Leiliang	SARS-CoV-2 causes the recent COVID-19 public health crisis. Bat is the widely believed original host of SARS-CoV-2. However, its intermediate host before transmitting to human is not clear. Some studies proposed pangolin, snake or turtle as the intermediate hosts. ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which determines the potential host range for SARS-CoV-2. Based on the structural information of the complex of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we analyzed the affinity to S protein of the 20 key residues in ACE2 from mammal, bird, turtle and snake. Several ACE2 proteins from Primates, Bovidae, Cricetidae and Cetacea maintained the majority of key residues in ACE2 for associating with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The simulated structures indicated that ACE2 proteins from Bovidae and Cricetidae were able to associate with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that nearly half of the key residues in turtle, snake and bird are changed. The simulated structures showed several key contacts with SARS-CoV-2 RBD in turtle and snake ACE2 were abolished. Our study demonstrated that neither snake nor turtle was the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, which further reinforced the concept that the reptiles are resistant against infection of coronavirus. Our study suggested that Bovidae and Cricetidae should be included in the screening of intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2. This article is protected by copyright.

Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease provides a basis for design of improved alpha-ketoamide inhibitors	Zhang, L.; Lin, D.; Sun, X.; Curth, U.; Drosten, C.; Sauerhering, L.; Becker, S.; Rox, K.; Hilgenfeld, R.	The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global health emergency. An attractive drug target among coronaviruses is the main protease (M(pro), 3CL(pro)), due to its essential role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. We report the X-ray structures of the unliganded SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and its complex with an alpha-ketoamide inhibitor. This was derived from a previously designed inhibitor but with the P3-P2 amide bond incorporated into a pyridone ring to enhance the half-life of the compound in plasma. Based on the structure, we developed the lead compound into a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) The pharmacokinetic characterization of the optimized inhibitor reveals a pronounced lung tropism and suitability for administration by the inhalative route.	2020	NA	Science (New York, N.Y.)

Infectious diseases in children and adolescents in China: analysis of national surveillance data from 2008 to 2017	Dong, Yanhui; Wang, Liping; Burgner, David P.; Miller, Jessica E.; Song, Yi; Ren, Xiang; Li, Zhongjie; Xing, Yi; Ma, Jun; Sawyer, Susan M.; Patton, George C.	Objectives To outline which infectious diseases in the pre-covid-19 era persist in children and adolescents in China and to describe recent trends and variations by age, sex, season, and province. Design National surveillance studies, 2008-17. Setting 31 provinces in mainland China. Participants 4â€‰959â€‰790 Chinese students aged 6 to 22 years with a diagnosis of any of 44 notifiable infectious diseases. The diseases were categorised into seven groups: quarantinable; vaccine preventable; gastrointestinal and enteroviral; vectorborne; zoonotic; bacterial; and sexually transmitted and bloodborne. Main outcome measures Diagnosis of, and deaths from, 44 notifiable infectious diseases. Results From 2008 to 2017, 44 notifiable infectious diseases were diagnosed in 4â€‰959â€‰790 participants (3â€‰045â€‰905 males, 1â€‰913â€‰885 females) and there were 2532 deaths (1663 males, 869 females). The leading causes of death among infectious diseases shifted from rabies and tuberculosis to HIV/AIDS, particularly in males. Mortality from infectious diseases decreased steadily from 0.21 per 100â€‰000 population in 2008 to 0.07 per 100â€‰000 in 2017. Quarantinable conditions with high mortality have effectively disappeared. The incidence of notifiable infectious diseases in children and adolescents decreased from 280 per 100â€‰000 in 2008 to 162 per 100â€‰000 in 2015, but rose again to 242 per 100â€‰000 in 2017, largely related to mumps and seasonal influenza. Excluding mumps and influenza, the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases fell from 96 per 100â€‰000 in 2008 to 7 per 100â€‰000 in 2017. The incidence of gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases remained constant, but typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery continued to decline. Vectorborne diseases all declined, with a particularly noticeable reduction in malaria. Zoonotic infections remained at low incidence, but there were still unpredictable outbreaks, such as pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza. Tuberculosis remained the most common bacterial infection, although cases of scarlet fever doubled between 2008 and 2017. Sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections increased significantly, particularly from 2011 to 2017, among which HIV/AIDS increased fivefold, particularly in males. Difference was noticeable between regions, with children and adolescents in western China continuing to carry a disproportionate burden from infectious diseases. Conclusions Chinaâ€™s success in infectious disease control in the pre-covid-19 era was notable, with deaths due to infectious diseases in children and adolescents aged 6-22 years becoming rare. Many challenges remain around reducing regional inequalities, scaling-up of vaccination, prevention of further escalation of HIV/AIDS, renewed efforts for persisting diseases, and undertaking early and effective response to highly transmissible seasonal and unpredictable diseases such as that caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.	2020	NA	BMJ	369	NA	m1043-m1043	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1043	26485	#27675	Dong 2020	NA	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1043	Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University; National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health, Haidian District, Beijing 100191, China|Department of Paediatrics, the University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care Medicine	('China', 1)|('Australia', 1)
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in covid-19	Ferner, Robin E.; Aronson, Jeffrey K.	Use of these drugs is premature and potentially harmful The BMJ in 1925 cautiously endorsed Moellgaardâ€™s gold treatment for tuberculosis,1 although it found his pharmacological reasoning â€œboth interesting and instructive.â€2 We should be similarly cautious about proposed treatments for people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes covid-19. Many proposals are based on in vitro investigations, studies in experimental animals, or experience with interventions in infections with other viruses, whether similar to SARS-CoV-2 (eg, SARS-CoV-1) or not (HIV). This is all true of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, both 4-aminoquinolines, which have been suggested as potential treatments for covid-19. Currently, at least 80 trials of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, or both, sometimes in combination with other drugs, are registered worldwide. The possible activity of 4-aminoquinolines in infectious mononucleosis was first proposed in 1960, before its viral cause was known.3 Several unsatisfactory clinical trials followed, some with positive results and some negative. In 1967 the authors of a small but well conducted randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial of chloroquine concluded that â€œexcept for supportive measures, infectious mononucleosis is essentially untreatable.â€4 Since then, many studies have shown that 4-aminoquinolines are â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	369	NA	m1432-m1432	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1432	45198	#42147	Ferner 2020	NA	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1432	Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care Medicine	('UK', 1)
Drugs and the renin-angiotensin system in covid-19	Aronson, Jeffrey K.; Ferner, Robin E.	Clinical effects are unpredictable, so treatment decisions must be tailored and pragmatic Covid-19, which is caused by the single stranded RNA coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, poses therapeutic dilemmas. Some suggestions for drug treatment seem problematic.1 They include various antiviral drugs, some of which have primary targets that are DNA viruses not RNA; immunomodulatory drugs, which may suppress potentially protective acute inflammatory responses and do not specifically target the virus; the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have some antiviral activity in vitro but no evidence of clinical benefit in human viral infections and also have many adverse effects; and corticosteroids, which may be harmful when used to treat infection with the related virus SARS-CoV-1.2 Important questions have also been raised about the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Do they have a role in treating covid-19? Should people currently taking them continue doing so, and should they stop if they become infected? No trial evidence is yet available on the effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in treating covid-19.

Overview of guidance for endoscopy during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic	Lui, Rashid N.; Wong, Sunny H.; SÃ¡nchez-Luna, Sergio A.; Pellino, Gianluca; Bollipo, Steven; Wong, Mei-Yin; Chiu, Philip W. Y.; Sung, Joseph J. Y.	Abstract From its beginning in December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak has spread globally from Wuhan and is now declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The sheer scale and severity of this pandemic is unprecedented in the modern era. Though primarily a respiratory tract infection transmitted by direct contact and droplets, during aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) there is a possibility of airborne transmission. In addition, emerging evidence suggests possible fecal-oral spread of the virus. Clinical departments that perform endoscopy are faced with daunting challenges during this pandemic. To date, multiple position statements and guidelines have been issued by various professional organizations to recommend practices in endoscopic procedures. This article aims to summarize and discuss available evidence for these practices, to provide guidance for endoscopy to enhance patient safety, avoid nosocomial outbreaks, protect healthcare personnel and ensure rational use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Responses adapted to national recommendations, local infection control guidelines and tailored to the availability of medical resources are imminently needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.	2020	NA	Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/jgh.15053	21139	#20511	Lui 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/jgh.15053	Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China|Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China|Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Sciences, Universit√† degli Studi della Campania "Luigi Vanvitelli", Naples, Italy|Department of Gastroenterology, John Hunter Hospital, New South Wales, Australia|Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China|Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China|Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China|Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China|Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China|Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Sciences, Universit√† degli Studi della Campania "Luigi Vanvitelli", Naples, Italy|Department of Gastroenterology, John Hunter Hospital, New South Wales, Australia|Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China|Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China|Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China|Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong	('China', 10)|('Italy', 2)|('Australia', 2)
Covid-19 and the Digestive System	Wong, S. H.; Lui, R. N.; Sung, J. J.	The novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is currently causing a major pandemic. It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the Betacoronavirus genus that also includes the SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). While patients typically present with fever and a respiratory illness, some patients also report gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Studies have identified the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens of infected patients, and its viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was found to be highly expressed in gastrointestinal epithelial cells. These suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can actively infect and replicate in the gastrointestinal tract. This has important implications to the disease management, transmission, and infection control. In this article, we review the important gastrointestinal aspects of the disease.	2020	NA	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	NA	NA	NA	32215956	10.1111/jgh.15047	18656	#18490	Wong 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Epidemiology	10.1111/jgh.15047	Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong|Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong	NA
Epidemiological Features of 135 Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in Tianjin, China	Cao, Chunxia; Li, Yue; Liu, Shuyu; Fan, Haojun; Hao, Liangchen	ObjectiveTo describe the epidemiologic features of an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Tianjin caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and to provide scientific basis for prevention and control measures.MethodsData from COVID-19 cases were collected from daily notifications given to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and Tianjin Health Committee. All of the data were analyzed with SPSS version 24.0 software.ResultsAs of February 24, 2020, there have been 135 confirmed cases, 3 deaths, and 87 recoveries in Tianjin, China. The incidence of COVID-19 was 8.65/1,000,000 with a 2.22% case fatality rate. Regarding geographic distribution, the incidence was 8.82 per 1,000,000 in urban areas and 8.00 per 1,000,000 in suburbs. During the early stage of the epidemic, most cases came from urban areas and in patients with a history of sojourning in Hubei Province. The majority of patients were 31â€“70 years old (75.97%). A familial cluster was the most important characteristic of COVID-19 (accounting for 74.81%).ConclusionsCurrent information suggests that people are generally susceptible to COVID-19, which has shown a familial cluster in Tianjin.

Risk Management of COVID-19 by Universities in China Short-term Forecasts of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China: February 13â€“23, 2020	Wang, Chuanyi; Cheng, Zhe; Yue, Xiao-Guang; McAleer, Michael; Roosa, Kimberlyn; Lee, Yiseul; Luo, Ruiyan; Kirpich, Alexander; Rothenberg, Richard; Hyman, M. James; Yan, Ping; Chowell, Gerardo	The rapid spread of new coronaviruses throughout China and the world in 2019&ndash;2020 has had a great impact on China&rsquo;s economic and social development. As the backbone of Chinese society, Chinese universities have made significant contributions to emergency risk management. Such contributions have been made primarily in the following areas: alumni resource collection, medical rescue and emergency management, mental health maintenance, control of staff mobility, and innovation in online education models. Through the support of these methods, Chinese universities have played a positive role in the prevention and control of the epidemic situation. However, they also face the problems of alumni&rsquo;s economic development difficulties, the risk of deadly infection to medical rescue teams and health workers, infection of teachers and students, and the unsatisfactory application of information technology in resolving the crisis. In response to these risks and emergency problems, we propose some corresponding solutions for public dissemination, including issues related to medical security, emergency research, professional assistance, positive communication, and hierarchical information-based teaching. The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic continues to spread within and outside of China, despite several social distancing measures implemented by the Chinese government. Limited epidemiological data are available, and recent changes in case definition and reporting further complicate our understanding of the impact of the epidemic, particularly in the epidemic&rsquo;s epicenter. Here we use previously validated phenomenological models to generate short-term forecasts of cumulative reported cases in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China. Using daily reported cumulative case data up until 13 February 2020 from the National Health Commission of China, we report 5- and 10-day ahead forecasts of cumulative case reports. Specifically, we generate forecasts using a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model, which have each been previously used to forecast outbreaks due to different infectious diseases. Forecasts from each of the models suggest the outbreaks may be nearing extinction in both Guangdong and Zhejiang; however, the sub-epidemic model predictions also include the potential for further sustained transmission, particularly in Zhejiang. Our 10-day forecasts across the three models predict an additional 65&ndash;81 cases (upper bounds: 169&ndash;507) in Guangdong and an additional 44&ndash;354 (upper bounds: 141&ndash;875) cases in Zhejiang by February 23, 2020. In the best-case scenario, current data suggest that transmission in both provinces is slowing down.	2020	NA	Journal of Risk and Financial Management	13	2	NA	NA	10.3390/jrfm13020036 ERT - Y - EJOU 10.3390/jcm9020596	1256	#1751	Wang 2020	NA	* Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Ethics, social science, economics; Infection prevention and control	10.3390/jrfm13020036	Institute of Education, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100091, China | School of Sciences, European University Cyprus, 1516 Nicosia, Cyprus | Department of Finance, College of Management, Asia University, Wufeng District, Taichung 41354, Taiwan | Discipline of Business Analytics, University of Sydney Business School, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia | Econometric Institute, Erasmus School of Economics, Erasmus University Rotterdam, 3062 Rotterdam, The Netherlands | Department of Economic Analysis and ICAE, Complutense University of Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain | Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Canterbury, Christchurch 8041, New Zealand | Institute of Advanced Sciences, Yokohama National University, Kanagawa 240-8501, Japan	('Cyprus', 2)|('China', 1)|('Australia', 1)|('Netherlands', 1)|('Spain', 1)|('New Zealand', 1)|('Japan', 1)

However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated. In this letter, we answered one comment on our guideline and provided the newest diagnostic criteria of â€œsuspected caseâ€ and â€œconfirmed caseâ€ according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) that issued by the National Health Committee of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.	2020	NA	Military Medical Research	7	1	17-17	NA	10.1186/s40779-020-00245-9	30971	#31673	Wang 2020	NA	NA	10.1186/s40779-020-00245-9	Institute of Evidence-Based Medicine and Knowledge Translation, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, Henan, China|Department of Clinical Laboratory, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei, China|Department of Radiology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei, China	('China', 3)
Structure-based stabilization of non-native protein-protein interactions of coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins in antiviral drug design	Lin, Shan-Meng; Lin, Shih-Chao; Hsu, Jia-Ning; Chang, Chung-ke; Chien, Ching-Ming; Wang, Yong-Sheng; Wu, Hung-Yi; Jeng, U. Ser; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Hou, Ming-hon	Structure-based stabilization of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is a promising strategy for drug discovery. However, this approach has mainly focused on the stabilization of native PPIs and non-native PPIs have received little consideration. Here, we identified a non-native interaction interface on the 3D dimeric structure of the N-terminal domain of the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (MERS-CoV N-NTD). The interface formed a conserved hydrophobic cavity suitable for targeted drug screening. By considering the hydrophobic complementarity during the virtual screening step, we identified 5-benzyloxygramine as a new N protein PPI orthosteric stabilizer that possesses both antiviral and N-NTD protein-stabilizing activity. X-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering showed that 5-benzyloxygramine stabilizes the N-NTD dimers through simultaneous hydrophobic interactions to both partners, resulting in abnormal N protein oligomerization that was further confirmed in the cell. This unique approach based on the identification and stabilization of non-native PPIs of N protein could be applied towards drug discovery against CoV diseases.	2020	NA	Journal of Medicinal Chemistry	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01913	2237	#2598	Lin 2020	NA	Virology, immunology	10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01913	Institute of Genomics and Bioinformatics, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan|Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan|Institute of Genomics and Bioinformatics, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan|Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan|Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan|Institute of Genomics and Bioinformatics, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan|Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan|Institute of Genomics and Bioinformatics, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan|Department of Chemical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan|Institute of Genomics and Bioinformatics, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan|Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan|Institutional Sales	NA

Epidemiology of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease-19 in Gansu Province, China, 2020	Fan, Jingchun; Liu, Xiaodong; Pan, Weimin; Douglas, Mark W.; Bao, Shisan	To determine the epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a remote region of China, far from Wuhan, we analyzed the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Gansu Province. From January 23 through February 3, 2020, a total of 35 (64.8%) of 54 reported cases were imported from COVID-19-epidemic areas. Characteristics that differed significantly during the first and second waves of illness in Gansu Province were mean patient age, occupation, having visited epidemic areas, and mode of transportation. Time from infection to illness onset for family clusters was shorter in Gansu Province than in Wuhan, consistent with shortened durations from onset to first medical visit or hospitalization. Spatial distribution pattern analysis indicated hot spots and spatial outliers in Gansu Province. As a result of adequate interventions, transmission of the COVID-19 virus in Gansu Province is decreasing.	2020	NA	Emerging infectious diseases	26	6	10.3201/eid2606.200251-10.3201/eid2606.200251	NA	10.3201/eid2606.200251	8756	#8374	Fan 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.3201/eid2606.200251	Institute of Immunization and Prevention Management, Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jinan, China (X.

Corticosteroid treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)	Zha, Lei; Li, Shirong; Pan, Lingling; Tefsen, Boris; Li, Yeshan; French, Neil; Chen, Liyun; Yang, Gang; Villanueva, Elmer V.	OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DESIGN, SETTING: Observational study in the two COVID-19-designated hospitals in Wuhu, Anhui province, China, 24 January - 24 February 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one patients infected with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) treated at the two designated hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Virus clearance time, length of hospital stay, and duration of symptoms, by treatment type (including or not including corticosteroid therapy). RESULTS: Eleven of 31 patients with COVID-19 received corticosteroid treatment. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicated no association between corticosteroid treatment and virus clearance time (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 0.58-2.74), hospital length of stay (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.33-1.78), or duration of symptoms (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.40-1.83). Univariate analysis indicated that virus clearance was slower in two patients with chronic hepatitis B infections (mean difference, 10.6 days; 95% CI, 6.2-15.1 days). CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids are widely used when treating patients with COVID-19, but we found no association between therapy and outcomes in patients without acute respiratory distress syndrome. An existing HBV infection may delay SARS-CoV-2 clearance, and this association should be further investigated.	2020	NA	The Medical journal of Australia	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.5694/mja2.50577	45110	#42055	Zha 2020	NA	NA	10.5694/mja2.50577	Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom|Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom	('United Kingdom', 2)
Evaluation of a quantitative RT-PCR assay for the detection of the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using a high throughput system	Pfefferle, Susanne; Reucher, Svenja; NÃ¶rz, Dominic; LÃ¼tgehetmann, Marc	The ability to quickly confirm or clear suspected cases is crucial during global outbreak scenarios, especially when clinical manifestations are difficult to distinguish from other respiratory infections such as influenza, molecular diagnostics is key for detection of the emerging virus. A variety of suitable assays were made available early on during the course of the outbreak, notably by Corman et al. and others [4,5]. However, their implementation in the diagnostics laboratory usually relies on manual PCR setups requiring a high degree of human interaction for execution and interpretation, thus limiting their capacity to be scaled up for handling large numbers of samples. In this study we report the analytical evaluation of a laboratory-developed test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using the open channel (utility channel) of the cobas 6800 system.%U https://eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.9.2000152	2020	NA	Eurosurveillance	25	9	2000152	NA	doi:https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.9.2000152	4872	#4473	Pfefferle 2020	NA	* Comparative study, RCT; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	doi:10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.9.2000152	Institute of Medical Microbiology, Virology and Hygiene, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), Hamburg, Germany	('UK', 1)|('Germany', 1)
Characterization of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 on virus entry and its immune cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV	Ou, Xiuyuan; Liu, Yan; Lei, Xiaobo; Li, Pei; Mi, Dan; Ren, Lili; Guo, Li; Guo, Ruixuan; Chen, Ting; Hu, Jiaxin; Xiang, Zichun; Mu, Zhixia; Chen, Xing; Chen, Jieyong; Hu, Keping; Jin, Qi; Wang, Jianwei; Qian, Zhaohui	Since 2002, beta coronaviruses (CoV) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks, SARS-CoV in 2002-2003, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019. However, little is currently known about the biology of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudovirus system, we confirm that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, find that SARS-CoV-2 enters 293/hACE2 cells mainly through endocytosis, that PIKfyve, TPC2, and cathepsin L are critical for entry, and that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is less stable than SARS-CoV S. Polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 inhibit entry of SARS-CoV S but not SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions. Further studies using recovered SARS and COVID-19 patients' sera show limited cross-neutralization, suggesting that recovery from one infection might not protect against the other. Our results present potential targets for development of drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.	2020	NA	Nature communications	11	1	1620-1620	NA	10.1038/s41467-020-15562-9	17683	#17830	Ou 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1038/s41467-020-15562-9	Institute of Medicinal Plant Development (IMPLAD), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) and Peking Union Medical Collage (PUMC), 151 Malianwa Road North, Haidian District, 100193, Beijing, China	('Mali', 1)|('China', 1)

Declining Public Health Protections within Autocratic Regimes: Impact on Global Public Health Security, Infectious Disease Outbreaks, Epidemics, and Pandemics	Burkle, Frederick M.	Public health emergencies of international concern, in the form of infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics, represent an increasing risk to the world's population. Management requires coordinated responses, across many disciplines and nations, and the capacity to muster proper national and global public health education, infrastructure, and prevention measures. Unfortunately, increasing numbers of nations are ruled by autocratic regimes which have characteristically failed to adopt investments in public health infrastructure, education, and prevention measures to keep pace with population growth and density. Autocratic leaders have a direct impact on health security, a direct negative impact on health, and create adverse political and economic conditions that only complicate the crisis further. This is most evident in autocratic regimes where health protections have been seriously and purposely curtailed. All autocratic regimes define public health along economic and political imperatives that are similar across borders and cultures. Autocratic regimes are seriously handicapped by sociopathic narcissistic leaders who are incapable of understanding the health consequences of infectious diseases or the impact on their population. A cross section of autocratic nations currently experiencing the impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) are reviewed to demonstrate the manner where self-serving regimes fail to manage health crises and place the rest of the world at increasing risk. It is time to re-address the pre-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) global agendas calling for stronger strategic capacity, legal authority, support, and institutional status under World Health Organization (WHO) leadership granted by an International Health Regulations Treaty. Treaties remain the most successful means the world has in preventing, preparing for, and controlling epidemics in an increasingly globalized world."Honesty is worth a lot more than hopeâ€¦" The Economist, February 17, 2020.	2020	NA	Prehospital and disaster medicine	NA	NA	Jan-38	NA	10.1017/S1049023X20000424	26543	#26863	Burkle 2020	NA	NA	10.1017/S1049023X20000424	Institute of Medicine, |Institute of Medicine (US) Forum on Microbial Threats|Institute of Medicine, 	NA
Responding to COVID-19: How to Navigate a Public Health Emergency Legally and Ethically	Gostin, Lawrence O.; Friedman, Eric A.; Wetter, Sarah A.	Abstract Few novel or emerging infectious diseases have posed such vital ethical challenges so quickly and dramatically as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern and recently classified COVID-19 as a worldwide pandemic. As of this writing, the epidemic has not yet peaked in the United States, but community transmission is widespread. President Trump declared a national emergency as fifty governors declared state emergencies. In the coming weeks, hospitals will become overrun, stretched to their capacities. When the health system becomes stretched beyond capacity, how can we ethically allocate scarce health goods and services? How can we ensure that marginalized populations can access the care they need? What ethical duties do we owe to vulnerable people separated from their families and communities? And how do we ethically and legally balance public health with civil liberties?	2020	NA	Hastings Center Report	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/hast.1090	17765	#18238	Gostin 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Epidemiology; Ethics, social science, economics	10.1002/hast.1090	Institute of Medicine, Committee on Guidance for Establishing Crisis Standards of Care for Use in Disaster Situations	NA

Clinical and biochemical indexes from 2019-nCoV infected patients linked to viral loads and lung injury	Liu, Yingxia; Yang, Yang; Zhang, Cong; Huang, Fengming; Wang, Fuxiang; Yuan, Jing; Wang, Zhaoqin; Li, Jinxiu; Li, Jianming; Feng, Cheng; Zhang, Zheng; Wang, Lifei; Peng, Ling; Chen, Li; Qin, Yuhao; Zhao, Dandan; Tan, Shuguang; Yin, Lu; Xu, Jun; Zhou, Congzhao; Jiang, Chengyu; Liu, Lei	The outbreak of the 2019-nCoV infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, and rapidly spread to many provinces in China as well as other countries. Here we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as potential biomarkers for predicting disease severity in 2019-nCoV-infected patients in Shenzhen, China. All 12 cases of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients developed pneumonia and half of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The most common laboratory abnormalities were hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM) and neutrophils (NEU), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased CD8 count. The viral load of 2019-nCoV detected from patient respiratory tracts was positively linked to lung disease severity. ALB, LYM, LYM (%), LDH, NEU (%), and CRP were highly correlated to the acute lung injury. Age, viral load, lung injury score, and blood biochemistry indexes, albumin (ALB), CRP, LDH, LYM (%), LYM, and NEU (%), may be predictors of disease severity. Moreover, the Angiotensin II level in the plasma sample from 2019-nCoV infected patients was markedly elevated and linearly associated to viral load and lung injury. Our results suggest a number of potential diagnosis biomarkers and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs for potential repurposing treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.	2020	NA	Science China Life Sciences	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1007/s11427-020-1643-8	511	#693	Liu 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1007/s11427-020-1643-8	Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China	('China', 1)

A familial cluster, including a kidney transplant recipient, of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China	Chen, Song; Yin, Qin; Shi, Huibo; Du, Dunfeng; Chang, Sheng; Ni, Li; Qiu, Haifang; Chen, Zhishui; Zhang, Jixian; Zhang, Weijie	Abstract In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, China, and spread to the whole of China and to multiple countries worldwide. Unlike SARS and MERS, where secondary transmission mostly occurred in hospital settings, COVID-19 transmission occurs in large numbers within families. Herein we report three cases of a familial cluster with one family member being a kidney transplant recipient. The initial clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in these three patients were the same, but their progression was different. Based on the severity of clinical symptoms, chest computer tomography findings and SARS-Cov-2 RNA test results, we admitted the husband to the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) and used a treatment consisting of immunosuppressant reduction/cessation and low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy, and his wife to the respiratory isolation ward. In contrast, the son received in-home isolation and home-based care. All three family members made a full recovery.	2020	NA	American Journal of Transplantation	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/ajt.15903	31088	#30788	Chen 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/ajt.15903	Institute of Organ Transplantation, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Wuhan, China|Institute of Organ Transplantation, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Institute of Organ Transplantation, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Institute of Organ Transplantation, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Wuhan, China|Institute of Organ Transplantation, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Wuhan, China|Institute of Organ Transplantation, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Institute of Organ Transplantation, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Wuhan, China|Institute of Organ Transplantation, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Institute of Organ Transplantation, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Institute of Organ Transplantation, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Wuhan, China|Institute of Organ Transplantation, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China|Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Wuhan, China|Institute of Organ Transplantation, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China	('China', 18)

The outbreak of COVID-19: An overview	Wu, Y. C.; Chen, C. S.; Chan, Y. J.	In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus#, emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries). The disease is officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020). It is also named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth category. COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2%-5%) mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs are under investigation. To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of the travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms.	2020	NA	Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA	83	3	217-220	32134861	10.1097/jcma.0000000000000270	5617	#5321	Wu 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1097/jcma.0000000000000270	Institute of Public Health, School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC	NA

Since December 2019, China has been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which can cause respiratory disease and severe pneumonia. We estimated the basic reproduction number R0 of 2019-nCoV to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval: 1.4-3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and pandemic influenza, indicating a risk of global spread.	2020	NA	Euro Surveill	25	4	10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.4.2000058	32019669	10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.4.2000058	583	#278	Riou 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.4.2000058	Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland	('Switzerland', 1)

The Covid-19 epidemic	Velavan, Thirumalaisamy P.; Meyer, Christian G.	Abstract The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019; previously 2019-nCoV), epi-centered in Hubei Province of the People's Republic of China, has spread to many other countries. On January 30, 2020, the WHO Emergency Committee declared a global health emergency based on growing case notification rates at Chinese and international locations.

Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2: A Brief Overview	Ludwig, Stephan; Zarbock, Alexander	In late December 2019 several cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported from China, which in early January 2020 were announced to be caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus was later denominated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and defined as the causal agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite massive attempts to contain the disease in China, the virus has spread globally, and COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Here we provide a short background on coronaviruses and describe in more detail the novel SARS-CoV-2 and attempts to identify effective therapies against COVID-19.

Preserving resources and manpower is paramount in healthcare. It is important to ensure the ability of surgeons and specialized professionals to function through the pandemic. A conscious effort should be made to minimize infection in this sector. A high mortality rate within this group would be detrimental. This manuscript is the result of a collaboration between the major Italian surgical and anesthesiologic societies: ACOI, SIC, SICUT, SICO, SICG, SIFIPAC, SICE, and SIAARTI. We aim to describe recommended clinical pathways for COVID-19-positive patients requiring acute non-deferrable surgical care.

INCIDENTAL FINDINGS SUGGESTIVE OF COVID-19 IN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS UNDERGOING NUCLEAR MEDICINE PROCEDURES IN A HIGH PREVALENCE REGION	Albano, Domenico; Bertagna, Francesco; Bertolia, Mattia; Bosio, Giovanni; Lucchini, Silvia; Motta, Federica; Panarotto, Maria Beatrice; Peli, Alessia; Camoni, Luca; Bengel, Frank M.; Giubbini, Raffaele	Infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 may remain asymptomatic, leading to under-recognition of the related disease, COVID-19, and to incidental findings in nuclear imaging procedures performed for standard clinical indications. Here, we report about our local experience in a region with high COVID-19 prevalence and dynamically increasing infection rates. Methods: Within the 8 day period of March 16-24, 2020, hybrid imaging studies of asymptomatic patients who underwent (18)F-FDG-PET/CT or (131)I-SPECT/CT for standard oncologic indications at our institution in Brescia, Italy, were analyzed for findings suggestive of COVID-19. Presence, radiological features and metabolic activity of interstitial pneumonia were identified, correlated with subsequent short-term clinical course and described in a case series. Results: Six of 65 patients (9%) that underwent PET/CT for various malignancies showed unexpected signs of interstitial pneumonia on CT and elevated regional FDG-avidity. Additionally, 1 of 12 patients who received radioiodine for differentiated thyroid carcinoma also showed interstitial pneumonia on SPECT/CT. 5/7 patients had subsequent proof of COVID-19 by RT-PCR. The remaining 2 patients were not tested immediately but underwent quarantine and careful monitoring. Conclusion: Incidental findings suggestive of COVID-19 may not be infrequent in hybrid imaging of asymptomatic patients, in regions with expansive spread of SARS-CoV-2. Nuclear medicine services should prepare accordingly.	2020	NA	Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.2967/jnumed.120.246256	26572	#27152	Albano 2020	NA	NA	10.2967/jnumed.120.246256	Institution: Universit√§tsbibliothek	NA
The antiviral compound remdesivir potently inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus	Gordon, Calvin J.; Tchesnokov, Egor P.; Feng, Joy Y.; Porter, Danielle P.; Gotte, Matthias	Antiviral drugs for managing infections with human coronaviruses are not yet approved, posing a serious challenge to current global efforts aimed at containing the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS-CoV nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS-CoV RdRp by RDV. We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogues. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at position i+3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the inhibitor from excision by the viral 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Together, these results help to explain the high potency of RDV against RNA viruses in cell-based assays.	2020	NA	J Biol Chem	NA	NA	jbc.AC120.013056	32094225	10.1074/jbc.AC120.013056	986	#1988	Gordon 2020	NA	Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Other related diseases and viruses; Virology, immunology	10.1074/jbc.AC120.013056	Institution: Universitaet Tuebingen|Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2E1, Canada	('Canada', 1)
The 2019-nCoV epidemic control strategies and future challenges of building healthy smart cities	Xu, Chunwen; Luo, Xilian; Yu, Chuck; Cao, Shi-Jie	reported and confirmed on 31 December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which is one of Chinaâ€™s largest cities and a major domestic transport hub (located in the central part of China, as shown in Figure 1).1 The epidemic is attracting worldwide concern due to its rapid spread and transmission rate between humans. On 30 January 2020, the International Health Regulations, Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak â€“ a â€˜public health emergency of international concernâ€™.2 On 8 February 2020 (24:00 GMT?+?8), there were 37,198 confirmed infections in China (including 811 deaths with a death ratio of 2.1%; and 6188 patients were confirmed in serious condition and 28,942 suspected cases).3 The COVID 19 infections were also reported in 26 other countries on 7 February 2020, including Canada, the USA, Australia, India, Sri-Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, the Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, Japan, Philippines, Nepal, United Arab Emirates, Russia, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Spain, France and the UK.4	2020	NA	Indoor and Built Environment	NA	NA	1420326X20910408	NA	10.1177/1420326X20910408	3176	#3268	Xu 2020	NA	* Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Epidemiology; Ethics, social science, economics; Infection prevention and control	10.1177/1420326X20910408	Institution|Institution|College of Pipeline and Civil Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China|College of Pipeline and Civil Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China|College of Pipeline and Civil Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China	('China', 6)
The Role of Emergency Radiology in COVID-19: From Preparedness to Diagnosis	Nasir, Muhammad Umer; Roberts, James; Muller, Nestor L.; Macri, Francesco; Mohammed, Mohammed F.; Akhlaghpoor, Shahram; Parker, William; Eftekhari, Arash; Rezaei, Susan; Mayo, John; Nicolaou, Savvas	Emergency trauma radiology, although a relatively new subspecialty of radiology, plays a critical role in both the diagnosis/triage of acutely ill patients, but even more important in providing leadership and taking the lead in the preparedness of imaging departments in dealing with novel highly infectious communicable diseases and mass casualties. This has become even more apparent in dealing with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, first emerged in late 2019. We review the symptoms, epidemiology, and testing for this disease. We discuss characteristic imaging findings of COVID-19 in relation to other modern coronavirus diseases including SARS and MERS. We discuss roles that community radiology clinics, outpatient radiology departments, and emergency radiology departments can play in the diagnosis of this disease. We review practical methods to reduce spread of infections within radiology departments.	2020	NA	Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal	NA	NA	0846537120916419-0846537120916419	NA	10.1177/0846537120916419	17803	#18006	Nasir 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Epidemiology	10.1177/0846537120916419	Institution|Institution|Department of Emergency and Trauma Radiology, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|Department of Radiology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|Department of Thoracic Radiology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|Department of Emergency and Trauma Radiology, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|Department of Radiology, Pardis Noor Medical Imaging Centers, Tehran, Iran|Department of Radiology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|Department of Thoracic Radiology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|Department of Emergency and Trauma Radiology, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|Department of Radiology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|Department of Emergency and Trauma Radiology, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|Department of Radiology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|Department of Thoracic Radiology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|Department of Radiology, Pardis Noor Medical Imaging Centers, Tehran, Iran	('Canada', 11)|('Iran', 2)

Role and Management of a Head and Neck Department during the COVID-19 Outbreak in Lombardy	Saibene, Alberto Maria; Allevi, Fabiana; Biglioli, Federico; Felisati, Giovanni	The recent Italian outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 led to an unprecedented burden on our health care system. Despite head and neck-otolaryngology not being a front-line specialty in dealing with this disease, our department had to face several specific issues. Despite a massive reallocation of resources in the hospital, we managed to keep the service active, improving safety measures for our personnel, specifically during common otolaryngologic maneuvers known to produce aerosols. Furthermore, we strived to maintain our teaching role, giving residents an inclusive role in managing the response to the emergency state, and we progressively integrated our inactive specialists into other service rotations to relieve front-line colleagues' burden. Specific issues and management decisions are discussed in detail in the article.	2020	NA	Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery	NA	NA	194599820917914-194599820917914	NA	10.1177/0194599820917914	37860	#38313	Saibene 2020	NA	NA	10.1177/0194599820917914	Institution|Institution|Department of Health Sciences, Universit√† degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy|Department of Health Sciences, Universit√† degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy|Department of Health Sciences, Universit√† degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy	('Italy', 3)
Visualising the expansion and spread of coronavirus disease 2019 by cartograms	Gao, Peichao; Zhang, Hong; Wu, Zhiwei; Wang, Jicheng	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a growing focus of global attention and a critical factor in public-health decision making. Towards fighting the COVID-19 outbreak, countries worldwide and international organisations have taken various actions, including promoting the transparency of and public access to disease data. In such public communications, maps have played an important role in that a map is worth a thousand words. Most of these have taken the form of a choropleth map. Here, we propose employing cartograms to visualise both the expansion and spread of COVID-19. We designed a combination of six circular cartograms containing the data of confirmed cases every 48 hours from 24 January to 3 February 2020. Such a design conveys both spatial and temporal information more intuitively and efficiently, so it can be expected to facilitate better public participation in the fight against COVID-19.	2020	NA	Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space	NA	NA	0308518X20910162	NA	10.1177/0308518X20910162	1460	#2287	Gao 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.1177/0308518X20910162	Institution|Institution|Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong; Faculty of Geosciences and Environmental Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, PR China|Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong; Faculty of Geosciences and Environmental Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, PR China|University of East Anglia	('China', 2)

Social media and moral panics: Assessing the effects of technological change on societal reaction	Walsh, James P.	Answering calls for deeper consideration of the relationship between moral panics and emergent media systems, this exploratory article assesses the effects of social media ? web-based venues that enable and encourage the production and exchange of user-generated content. Contra claims of their empowering and deflationary consequences, it finds that, on balance, recent technological transformations unleash and intensify collective alarm. Whether generating fear about social change, sharpening social distance, or offering new opportunities for vilifying outsiders, distorting communications, manipulating public opinion, and mobilizing embittered individuals, digital platforms and communications constitute significant targets, facilitators, and instruments of panic production. The conceptual implications of these findings are considered.	2020	NA	International Journal of Cultural Studies	NA	NA	1367877920912257-1367877920912257	NA	10.1177/1367877920912257	17804	#17676	Walsh 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Ethics, social science, economics	10.1177/1367877920912257	Institution|Institution|University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Canada|University of Westminster Press|University of Minnesota Press	('Canada', 1)

Bearing the brunt of covid-19: older people in low and middle income countries	Lloyd-Sherlock, Peter; Ebrahim, Shah; Geffen, Leon; McKee, Martin	A global expert group on older people might be useful The global response to covid-19 has been described as being â€œtoo little, too late.â€1 National and international efforts are now gathering pace. Those involved in these efforts can draw on a rapidly growing body of research, much summarised in regularly updated guidelines published by national and international authorities, covering the latest information on the virus, its mode of transmission, its spread, and the susceptibility of different groups within the population. Although many aspects of this new infection remain uncertain, one thing is already clear. The risk of dying from covid-19 increases with age, and most of the deaths observed are in people older than 60, especially those with chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease. This has important implications for the way in which public health and clinical responses should be developed. Yet, to date, guidance largely ignores this issue, not only in high income countries,2 but in low and middle income countries (LMICs), which contain 69% of the global population aged â‰¥60 and where health systems are weaker and covid-19 could potentially have the greatest impact. In LMIC settings, there are at least four issues to consider. â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1052-m1052	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1052	8831	#8437	Lloyd-Sherlock 2020	NA	* Case study/series; * Epidemiological study; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1136/bmj.m1052	Institutional ageism in global health policy|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust: Consultant in Palliative Care Medicine	NA

Nuclear medicine in SARS-CoV-2 pandemia: 18F-FDG-PET/CT toÂ visualize COVID-19	LÃ¼tje, Susanne; Marinova, Milka; KÃ¼tting, Daniel; Attenberger, Ulrike; Essler, Markus; Bundschuh, Ralph Alexander	The current outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has reached multiple countries worldwide. While the number of newly diagnosed cases and fatalities is rising quickly, far-reaching measures were enacted to prevent further spread. Diagnosis relies on clinical presentation, exposure history, PCR using specimens from the respiratory tract together with computed tomography (CT) imaging. One of the hallmarks of a critical course of COVID-19 is the development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). As management of COVID-19 can be considered a multi-disciplinary approach involving various medical specialties, we here review the first (18)F-FDG-PET/CT scans of COVID-19 to discuss how Nuclear Medicine could contribute to management of this disease.	2020	NA	Nuklearmedizin.

Quarantine Vehicle Scheduling for Transferring High-Risk Individuals in Epidemic Areas	Zhang, Min-Xia; Yan, Hong-Fan; Wu, Jia-Yu; Zheng, Yu-Jun	In a large-scale epidemic outbreak, there can be many high-risk individuals to be transferred for medical isolation in epidemic areas. Typically, the individuals are scattered across different locations, and available quarantine vehicles are limited. Therefore, it is challenging to efficiently schedule the vehicles to transfer the individuals to isolated regions to control the spread of the epidemic. In this paper, we formulate such a quarantine vehicle scheduling problem for high-risk individual transfer, which is more difficult than most well-known vehicle routing problems. To efficiently solve this problem, we propose a hybrid algorithm based on the water wave optimization (WWO) metaheuristic and neighborhood search. The metaheuristic uses a small population to rapidly explore the solution space, and the neighborhood search uses a gradual strategy to improve the solution accuracy. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms several existing algorithms and obtains high-quality solutions on real-world problem instances for high-risk individual transfer in Hangzhou, China, during the peak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19).	2020	NA	International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health 2020, Vol. 17, Page 2275	17	7	2275-2275	NA	10.3390/IJERPH17072275	17621	#17675	Zhang 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology	10.3390/IJERPH17072275	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310023, China	('China', 1)
Prediction of Number of Cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Using Social Media Search Index	Qin, Lei; Sun, Qiang; Wang, Yidan; Wu, Ke-Fei; Chen, Mingchih; Shia, Ben-Chang; Wu, Szu-Yuan	Predicting the number of new suspected or confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is crucial in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak. Social media search indexes (SMSI) for dry cough, fever, chest distress, coronavirus, and pneumonia were collected from 31 December 2019 to 9 February 2020. The new suspected cases of COVID-19 data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 9 February 2020. We used the lagged series of SMSI to predict new suspected COVID-19 case numbers during this period. To avoid overfitting, five methods, namely subset selection, forward selection, lasso regression, ridge regression, and elastic net, were used to estimate coefficients. We selected the optimal method to predict new suspected COVID-19 case numbers from 20 January 2020 to 9 February 2020. We further validated the optimal method for new confirmed cases of COVID-19 from 31 December 2019 to 17 February 2020. The new suspected COVID-19 case numbers correlated significantly with the lagged series of SMSI. SMSI could be detected 6â€“9 days earlier than new suspected cases of COVID-19. The optimal method was the subset selection method, which had the lowest estimation error and a moderate number of predictors. The subset selection method also significantly correlated with the new confirmed COVID-19 cases after validation. SMSI findings on lag day 10 were significantly correlated with new confirmed COVID-19 cases. SMSI could be a significant predictor of the number of COVID-19 infections. SMSI could be an effective early predictor, which would enable governmentsâ€™ health departments to locate potential and high-risk outbreak areas.	2020	NA	International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health	17	7	2365-2365	NA	10.3390/ijerph17072365	21022	#20554	Qin 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/ijerph17072365	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|College of Management, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan|Department of Food Nutrition and Health Biotechnology, College of Medical and Health Science, Asia University, Taichung 41354, Taiwan|Department of Healthcare Administration, College of Medical and Health Science, Asia University, Taichung 41354, Taiwan	NA
Association between Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Lung Cancerâ€”A Nationwide, Population-Based, Propensity Score-Matched Cohort Study	Lin, Shih-Yi; Lin, Cheng-Li; Lin, Cheng-Chieh; Hsu, Wu-Huei; Lin, Chia-Der; Wang, I. Kuan; Hsu, Chung- Y.; Kao, Chia-Hung	Background: Direct evidence of lung cancer risk in Asian users of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is lacking. Methods: The ACEI cohort comprised 22,384 patients aged &ge; 18 years with a first prescription of ACEI. The comparison angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) cohort consisted of age-, sex- and comorbidity-matched patients at a ratio of 1:1. The primary outcome was the incidence of lung cancer, which was evaluated using a proportional hazard model. Results: The overall incidence rates of lung cancer in the ACEI and ARB cohorts were 16.6 and 12.2 per 10,000 person-years, respectively. The ACEI cohort had a significantly higher risk of lung cancer than the ARB cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]. = 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]. = 1.11&ndash;1.67). Duration&ndash;response and dose&ndash;response analyses revealed that compared with patients who did not receive ACEIs, patients who received ACEIs for more than 45 days per year (aHR = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.48&ndash;2.36) and patients who received more than 540 defined daily doses of ACEIs per year (aHR =1.80; 95% CI = 1.43&ndash;-2.27) had a significantly higher risk of lung cancer. The cumulative incidence of lung cancer was also significantly higher in the ACEI cohort than in the ARB cohort (log-rank test, p = 0.002). Conclusions: ACEI use is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer compared with ARB use. Patients using ARBs have a significantly lower risk of lung cancer than non-ARB users.	2020	NA	Cancers 2020, Vol. 12, Page 747	12	3	747-747	NA	10.3390/CANCERS12030747	12290	#11359	Lin 2020	NA	* Comparative study, RCT; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.3390/CANCERS12030747	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung 40447, Taiwan|Department of Family Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40447, Taiwan|Department of Chest Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40447, Taiwan|Department of Otolaryngology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40447, Taiwan|Department of Nuclear Medicine and PET Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40447, Taiwan|Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering, Asia University, Taichung 40447, Taiwan	('China', 5)
Potential maternal and infant outcomes from coronavirus 2019-NCOV (SARS-CoV-2) infecting pregnant women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and other human coronavirus infections	Schwartz, D. A.; Graham, A. L.	In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China. Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified coronavirus, initially termed 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. The infection moved rapidly through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic. In order to assess the potential of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of SARS, MERS, and other coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants. Recommendations are also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design, clinical trials, and implementation of future 2019-nCoV vaccines.	2020	NA	Viruses	12	2	NA	NA	10.3390/v12020194	9399	#8964	Schwartz 2020	NA	* Narrative review; * Opinion piece; Epidemiology; Infection prevention and control	10.3390/v12020194	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Anthropology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269, USA	('USA', 1)

Response to the COVID-19 Epidemic: The Chinese Experience and Implications for Other Countries	Liu, Wei; Yue, Xiao-Guang; Tchounwou, Paul B.	The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that occurred in China is rapidly spreading globally. China&rsquo;s bond and strict containment measures have been proved (in practice) to significantly reduce the spread of the epidemic. This was obtained through the use of emergency control measures in the epidemic areas and the integration of resources from multiple systems, including business, community, technology, education, and transportation, across the country. In order to better understand how China has managed to reduce the public health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic, this editorial systematically reviews the specific measures for infection prevention and control of the disease. The best practices for COVID-19 eradication in China provide evidence-based strategies that could be replicated in other countries.	2020	NA	International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health 2020, Vol. 17, Page 2304	17	7	2304-2304	NA	10.3390/IJERPH17072304	17626	#17674	Liu 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Epidemiology	10.3390/IJERPH17072304	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Biology, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, Box 18750, Jackson, MS 39217, USA	('USA', 1)
Potential Factors Influencing Repeated SARS Outbreaks in China	Sun, Zhong; Thilakavathy, Karuppiah; Kumar, S. S.; He, Guozhong; Liu, V. Shi	Within last 17 years two widespread epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in China, which were caused by related coronaviruses (CoVs): SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Although the origin(s) of these viruses are still unknown and their occurrences in nature are mysterious, some general patterns of their pathogenesis and epidemics are noticeable. Both viruses utilize the same receptor&mdash;angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)&mdash;for invading human bodies. Both epidemics occurred in cold dry winter seasons celebrated with major holidays, and started in regions where dietary consumption of wildlife is a fashion. Thus, if bats were the natural hosts of SARS-CoVs, cold temperature and low humidity in these times might provide conducive environmental conditions for prolonged viral survival in these regions concentrated with bats. The widespread existence of these bat-carried or -released viruses might have an easier time in breaking through human defenses when harsh winter makes human bodies more vulnerable. Once succeeding in making some initial human infections, spreading of the disease was made convenient with increased social gathering and holiday travel. These natural and social factors influenced the general progression and trajectory of the SARS epidemiology. However, some unique factors might also contribute to the origination of SARS in Wuhan. These factors are discussed in different scenarios in order to promote more research for achieving final validation.	2020	NA	International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health	17	5	NA	NA	10.3390/ijerph17051633	3205	#3296	Sun 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Epidemiology; Ethics, social science, economics; Other related diseases and viruses; Reservoir; Virology, immunology	10.3390/ijerph17051633	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, University Putra Malaysia, UPM Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia|Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, University Putra Malaysia, UPM Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia|Institute of Health, Kunming Medical University, Kunming 650500, China	('Malaysia', 4)|('China', 1)
Viruses of Respiratory Tract: an Observational Retrospective Study on Hospitalized Patients in Rome, Italy	Ciotti, Marco; Maurici, Massimo; Santoro, Viviana; Coppola, Luigi; Sarmati, Loredana; De Carolis, Gerardo; De Filippis, Patrizia; Pica, Francesca	<p>Respiratory tract infections account for high morbidity and mortality around the world. Fragile patients are at high risk of developing complications such as pneumonia and may die from it. Limited information is available on the extent of the circulation of respiratory viruses in the hospital setting. Most knowledge relates to influenza viruses (FLU) but several other viruses produce flu-like illness. The study was conducted at the University Hospital Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy. Clinical and laboratory data from hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections during the period October 2016â€“March 2019 were analysed. The retrospective analysis included 17 viral agents detected by FilmArray test and clinical data from medical records and hospital discharge sheets. Models were adjusted for relevant confounders such as clinical severity and risk of death, socio-demographic characteristics and surgical procedures. From a total of 539 specimens analysed, 180 (33.39%) were positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Among them, 83 (46.1 %) were positive for influenza viruses (FLU), 36 (20%) rhino/enteroviruses (RHV/EV), 17 (9.44%) human coronaviruses (HCOV-229E, -HKU1, -NL63, and -OC43), 17 (9.44%) respiratory syncytial virus, 15 (8.33%) human metapneumovirus (HMPV), 8 (4.44%) parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and 4 (2.22%) adenoviruses (ADV). The distribution of viral agents varied across age groups and month of detection. The positive specimens were from 168 patients [102 M, 66 F; median age (range): 64 years (19âˆ’93)]. Overall, 40% of them had a high-grade clinical severity and a 27% risk of death; 27 patients died and 22 of them (81.5%) had received a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. Respiratory viral infections may have a severe course and a poor prognosis in hospitalized patients, due to underlying comorbidities. Monitoring the circulation of respiratory viruses in hospital settings is important to improve diagnosis, prevention and treatment.</p>	2020	NA	Microorganisms	8	4	501-501	NA	10.3390/microorganisms8040501	25905	#23851	Ciotti 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/microorganisms8040501	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133 Rome, Italy|Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133 Rome, Italy	('Italy', 2)
Evolutionary Trajectory for the Emergence of Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2	Rehman, Saif ur; Shafique, Laiba; Ihsan, Awais; Liu, Qingyou	Over the last two decades, the world experienced three outbreaks of coronaviruses with elevated morbidity rates. Currently, the global community is facing emerging virus SARS-CoV-2 belonging to Betacoronavirus, which appears to be more transmissible but less deadly than SARS-CoV. The current study aimed to track the evolutionary ancestors and different evolutionary strategies that were genetically adapted by SARS-CoV-2. Our whole-genome analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was the descendant of Bat SARS/SARS-like CoVs and bats served as a natural reservoir. SARS-CoV-2 used mutations and recombination as crucial strategies in different genomic regions including the envelop, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike glycoproteins to become a novel infectious agent. We confirmed that mutations in different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have specific influence on virus reproductive adaptability, allowing for genotype adjustment and adaptations in rapidly changing environments. Moreover, for the first time we identified nine putative recombination patterns in SARS-CoV-2, which encompass spike glycoprotein, RdRp, helicase and ORF3a. Six recombination regions were spotted in the S gene and are undoubtedly important for evolutionary survival, meanwhile this permitted the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to find a way from immune reconnaissance in animals and adapt to a human host. With these combined natural selected strategies, SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a novel virus in human society.	2020	NA	Pathogens 2020, Vol. 9, Page 240	9	3	240-240	NA	10.3390/PATHOGENS9030240	12444	#11983	Rehman 2020	NA	Reservoir; Virology, immunology	10.3390/PATHOGENS9030240	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Biosciences, COMSATS University Islamabad, Sahiwal Campus 57000, Pakistan|College of Pharmacy, South Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, China	('Pakistan', 1)|('China', 1)
2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Paving the Road for Rapid Detection and Point-of-Care Diagnostics	Nguyen, Trieu; Bang, Dang Duong; Wolff, Anders	We believe a point-of-care (PoC) device for the rapid detection of the 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial and urgently needed.

Does Employee Quality Affect Corporate Social Responsibility? Evidence from China	Sun, Shilu; Li, Tiantian; Ma, Hong; Li, Rita Yi Man; Gouliamos, Kostas; Zheng, Jianming; Han, Yan; Manta, Otilia; Comite, Ubaldo; Barros, Teresa; Duarte, Nelson; Yue, Xiao-Guang	This paper investigated the impact of employee quality on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Based on data from China A-share-listed companies for the years 2012&ndash;2016 and using ordinary least squares, our empirical results show that the educational level of the workforce, as a proxy for employee quality, is positively associated with CSR, which suggests that higher education can promote CSR implementation. Additional analyses found that this positive relationship is more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises, enterprises in regions with lower marketisation processes, and firms with lower proportions of independent directors. This study extends the literature on human capital at the level of firms&rsquo; entire workforce and CSR by elaborating the positive effect of employee quality on CSR in the context of an emerging economy (China). The results suggest that it is necessary to consider the educational level of employees when analysing CSR, which is of strategic significance for corporate sustainable development.	2020	NA	Sustainability 2020, Vol. 12, Page 2692	12	7	2692-2692	NA	10.3390/SU12072692	19052	#19439	Sun 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/SU12072692	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Business Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy|Department of Law and Business Sciences, University Giustino Fortunato, 82100 Benevento, Italy	('Italy', 2)

SARS-CoV-2 and Coronavirus Disease 2019: What We Know So Far	Rabi, Firas A.; Al Zoubi, Mazhar S.; Kasasbeh, Ghena A.; Salameh, Dunia M.; Al-Nasser, Amjad D.	<p>In December 2019, a cluster of fatal pneumonia cases presented in Wuhan, China. They were caused by a previously unknown coronavirus. All patients had been associated with the Wuhan Wholefood market, where seafood and live animals are sold. The virus spread rapidly and public health authorities in China initiated a containment effort. However, by that time, travelers had carried the virus to many countries, sparking memories of the previous coronavirus epidemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and causing widespread media attention and panic. Based on clinical criteria and available serological and molecular information, the new disease was called coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and the novel coronavirus was called SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emphasizing its close relationship to the 2002 SARS virus (SARS-CoV). The scientific community raced to uncover the origin of the virus, understand the pathogenesis of the disease, develop treatment options, define the risk factors, and work on vaccine development.

Optimization Method for Forecasting Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 in China	Al-Qaness, Mohammed A. A.; Ewees, Ahmed A.; Fan, Hong; Abd El Aziz, Mohamed	In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, called COVID-19, was discovered in Wuhan, China, and has spread to different cities in China as well as to 24 other countries. The number of confirmed cases is increasing daily and reached 34,598 on 8 February 2020. In the current study, we present a new forecasting model to estimate and forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the upcoming ten days based on the previously confirmed cases recorded in China. The proposed model is an improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using an enhanced flower pollination algorithm (FPA) by using the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). In general, SSA is employed to improve FPA to avoid its drawbacks (i.e., getting trapped at the local optima). The main idea of the proposed model, called FPASSA-ANFIS, is to improve the performance of ANFIS by determining the parameters of ANFIS using FPASSA. The FPASSA-ANFIS model is evaluated using the World Health Organization (WHO) official data of the outbreak of the COVID-19 to forecast the confirmed cases of the upcoming ten days. More so, the FPASSA-ANFIS model is compared to several existing models, and it showed better performance in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), and computing time. Furthermore, we tested the proposed model using two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in two countries, namely the USA and China. The outcomes also showed good performances.	2020	NA	J Clin Med	9	3	E674	32131537	10.3390/jcm9030674	4648	#4638	Al-Qaness 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.3390/jcm9030674	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of e-Systems, University of Bisha, Bisha 61922, Saudi Arabia|Department of Computer, Damietta University, Damietta 34517, Egypt|Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Zagazig University, Zagazig 44519, Egypt	('Egypt', 2)|('Saudi Arabia', 1)
Optimization Method for Forecasting Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 in China Prevention Is Better Than the Cure: Risk Management of COVID-19 Synthesis and Bioactivity Assessment of Novel Spiro Pyrazole-Oxindole Congeners Exhibiting Potent and Selective in vitro Anticancer Effects	Al-qaness, A.

Furthermore, we tested the proposed model using two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in two countries, namely the USA and China. The outcomes also showed good performances. A novel coronavirus was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in China on 31 December 2019. The WHO named the disease COVID-19 on 11 February 2020. As of 26 February 2020, the disease has been detected on all continents, except for Antarctica. Daily updates on COVID-19 since early February 2020 have made headline news worldwide for much of 2020. This editorial evaluates risk management based on the Global Health Security (GHS) Index of global health security capabilities in 195 countries. The GHS Index lists the countries best prepared for an epidemic or pandemic. COVID-19 is compared with two related coronavirus epidemics, SARS and MERS, in terms of the number of reported human infections, deaths, countries, major country clusters, timelines, and the likelihood of discovering a safe, effective, and approved vaccine. The present work aims to design and synthesize novel series of spiro pyrazole-3,3&rsquo;-oxindoles analogues and investigate their bioactivity as antioxidant and antimicrobial agents, as well as antiproliferative potency against selected human cancerous cell lines (i.e., breast, MCF-7; colon, HCT-116 and liver, HepG-2) relative to healthy noncancerous control skin fibroblast cells (BJ-1). The mechanism of their cytotoxic activity has been also examined by immunoassaying the levels of key anti- and proapoptotic protein markers. The analytical and spectral data of the all synthesized target congeners were compatible with their structures. Synthesized compounds showed diverse moderate to powerful antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Results of MTT assay revealed that seven synthesized compounds (i.e., 11a, 11b, 12a, 12b, 13b, 13c and 13h) particularly exhibited significant cytotoxicity against the three cancerous cell lines under investigation. Ranges of IC50 values obtained were 5.7&ndash;21.3 and 5.8&ndash;37.4 &micro;g/mL against HCT-116 and MCF-7, respectively; which is 3.8 and 6.5-fold (based on the least IC50 values) more significant relative to the reference chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. In HepG-2 cells, the analogue 13h the highest cytotoxicity with IC50 value of 19.2&micro;g/mL relative to doxorubicin (IC50 = 21.6&micro;g/mL). The observed cytotoxicity was specific to cancerous cells, as evidenced by the minimal toxicity in the noncancerous control skin-fibroblast cells. ELISA results indicated that the observed antiproliferative effect against examined cancer cell lines is mediated via engaging the activation of apoptosis as illustrated by the significant increase in proapoptotic protein markers (p53, bax and caspase-3) and reduction in the antiapoptotic marker bcl-2. Taken together, results of the present study emphasize the potential of spiro pyrazole-oxindole analogues as valuable candidate anticancer agents against human cancer cells.	2020	NA	Journal of Clinical Medicine	9	3	NA	NA	10.3390/jcm9030674 10.3390/jrfm13030046 10.3390/molecules25051124ER -	3204	#3465	Al-qaness 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.3390/jcm9030674	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of e-Systems, University of Bisha, Bisha 61922, Saudi Arabia|Department of Computer, Damietta University, Damietta 34517, Egypt|Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Zagazig University, Zagazig 44519, Egypt	('Egypt', 2)|('Saudi Arabia', 1)
Preliminary Identification of Potential Vaccine Targets for the COVID-19 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Based on SARS-CoV Immunological Studies	Ahmed, F. Syed; Quadeer, A. Ahmed; McKay, R. Matthew	The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.	2020	NA	Viruses	12	3	NA	NA	10.3390/v12030254	1072	#2017	Ahmed 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Other related diseases and viruses; Vaccines; Virology, immunology	10.3390/v12030254	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China|Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China	('China', 2)
Virology, Epidemiology, Pathogenesis, and Control of COVID-19	Jin, Yuefei; Yang, Haiyan; Ji, Wangquan; Wu, Weidong; Chen, Shuaiyin; Zhang, Weiguo; Duan, Guangcai	The outbreak of emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) in China has been brought to global attention and declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Scientific advancements since the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002~2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 have accelerated our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of therapeutics to treat viral infection. As no specific therapeutics and vaccines are available for disease control, the epidemic of COVID-19 is posing a great threat for global public health. To provide a comprehensive summary to public health authorities and potential readers worldwide, we detail the present understanding of COVID-19 and introduce the current state of development of measures in this review.	2020	NA	Viruses 2020, Vol. 12, Page 372	12	4	372-372	NA	10.3390/V12040372	17622	#17449	Jin 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.3390/V12040372	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China|Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA	('China', 1)|('uk', 1)|('USA', 1)

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and Quality of Life among Local Residents in Liaoning Province, China: A Cross-Sectional Study	Zhang, Yingfei; Ma, Zheng Feei	Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and quality of life among local Chinese residents aged &ge;18 years in Liaoning Province, mainland China. An online survey was distributed through a social media platform between January and February 2020. Participants completed a modified validated questionnaire that assessed the Impact of Event Scale (IES), indicators of negative mental health impacts, social and family support, and mental health-related lifestyle changes. A total of 263 participants (106 males and 157 females) completed the study. The mean age of the participants was 37.7 &plusmn; 14.0 years, and 74.9% had a high level of education. The mean IES score in the participants was 13.6 &plusmn; 7.7, reflecting a mild stressful impact. Only 7.6% of participants had an IES score &ge;26. The majority of participants (53.3%) did not feel helpless due to the pandemic. On the other hand, 52.1% of participants felt horrified and apprehensive due to the pandemic. Additionally, the majority of participants (57.8&ndash;77.9%) received increased support from friends and family members, increased shared feeling and caring with family members and others. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with mild stressful impact in our sample, even though the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing. These findings would need to be verified in larger population studies.	2020	NA	International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health 2020, Vol. 17, Page 2381	17	7	2381-2381	NA	10.3390/IJERPH17072381	21024	#20552	Zhang 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/IJERPH17072381	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou 215123, China	('China', 1)

In order to control the spread of an epidemic, the effective management of rapidly increased medical waste through establishing a temporary reverse logistics system is of vital importance. However, no research has been conducted with the focus on the design of an epidemic reverse logistics network for dealing with medical waste during epidemic outbreaks, which, if improperly treated, may accelerate disease spread and pose a significant risk for both medical staffs and patients. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse logistics network design in epidemic outbreaks, which aims at determining the best locations of temporary facilities and the transportation strategies for effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste within a very short period. The application of the model is illustrated with a case study based on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Even though the uncertainty of the future COVID-19 spread tendency is very high at the time of this research, several general policy recommendations can still be obtained based on computational experiments and quantitative analyses. Among other insights, the results suggest installing temporary incinerators may be an effective solution for managing the tremendous increase of medical waste during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, but the location selection of these temporary incinerators is of significant importance. Due to the limitation on available data and knowledge at present stage, more real-world information are needed to assess the effectiveness of the current solution.	2020	NA	International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health	17	5	NA	NA	10.3390/ijerph17051770	5829	#5779	Yu 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Infection prevention and control	10.3390/ijerph17051770	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Industrial Engineering, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Lodve Langesgate 2, 8514 Narvik, Norway	('Norway', 2)
Lung Involvement Found on Chest CT Scan in a Pre-Symptomatic Person with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Case Report	Asadollahi-Amin, Ali; Hasibi, Mehrdad; Ghadimi, Fatemeh; Rezaei, Hosnieh; SeyedAlinaghi, SeyedAhmad	The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection is spreading worldwide, and there are many reports of acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by this infection. However, asymptomatic lung involvement has not been reported. We hereby present the case of a 44-year-old health-care worker, who was found to be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus after a CT-scan performed for an unrelated condition revealed a lesion in the lung field compatible with COVID-19 infection. His condition deteriorated initially, but eventually improved with supportive treatment and the compassionate use of antivirals and antimalarials and is now in a stable condition.	2020	NA	Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease 2020, Vol. 5, Page 56	5	2	56-56	NA	10.3390/TROPICALMED5020056	37755	#38259	Asadollahi-Amin 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/TROPICALMED5020056	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Infectious Diseases, Amir Alam Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 131851678, Iran	('Iran', 1)
People with Suspected COVID-19 Symptoms Were More Likely Depressed and Had Lower Health-Related Quality of Life: The Potential Benefit of Health Literacy	Nguyen, Hoang C.; Nguyen, Minh H.; Do, Binh N.; Tran, Cuong Q.; Nguyen, Thao T.

M.; Yang, Shwu-Huey; Chao, Jane C. J.; Duong, Tuyen Van	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic affects peopleâ€™s health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), especially in those who have suspected COVID-19 symptoms (S-COVID-19-S). We examined the effect of modifications of health literacy (HL) on depression and HRQoL. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 14 February to 2 March 2020. 3947 participants were recruited from outpatient departments of nine hospitals and health centers across Vietnam. The interviews were conducted using printed questionnaires including participantsâ€™ characteristics, clinical parameters, health behaviors, HL, depression, and HRQoL. People with S-COVID-19-S had a higher depression likelihood (OR, 2.88; p < 0.001), lower HRQoL-score (B, âˆ’7.92; p < 0.001). In comparison to people without S-COVID-19-S and low HL, those with S-COVID-19-S and low HL had 9.70 times higher depression likelihood (p < 0.001), 20.62 lower HRQoL-score (p < 0.001), for the people without S-COVID-19-S, 1 score increment of HL resulted in 5% lower depression likelihood (p < 0.001) and 0.45 higher HRQoL-score (p < 0.001), while for those people with S-COVID-19-S, 1 score increment of HL resulted in a 4% lower depression likelihood (p = 0.004) and 0.43 higher HRQoL-score (p < 0.001). People with S-COVID-19-S had a higher depression likelihood and lower HRQoL than those without. HL shows a protective effect on depression and HRQoL during the epidemic.	2020	NA	Journal of Clinical Medicine 2020, Vol. 9, Page 965	9	4	965-965	NA	10.3390/JCM9040965	21021	#20516	Nguyen 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/JCM9040965	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Infectious Diseases, Military Medical University, Hanoi 121-08, Vietnam|Department of Anesthesiology, Thu Duc District Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City 713-11, Vietnam|Department of Pulmonary & Cardiovascular Diseases, Hai Phong University of Medicine and Pharmacy Hospital, Hai Phong 042-12, Vietnam|Department of Internal Medicine, Thai Nguyen University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Thai Nguyen City 241-17, Vietnam|Department of Health Education, Faculty of Social Sciences, Behavior and Health Education, Hanoi University of Public Health, Hanoi 119-10, Vietnam	('Vietnam', 5)
A New Application of Social Impact in Social Media for Overcoming Fake News in Health	Pulido, Cristina M.; Ruiz-Eugenio, Laura; Redondo-Sama, Gisela; Villarejo-Carballido, Beatriz	One of the challenges today is to face fake news (false information) in health due to its potential impact on people&rsquo;s lives. This article contributes to a new application of social impact in social media (SISM) methodology. This study focuses on the social impact of the research to identify what type of health information is false and what type of information is evidence of the social impact shared in social media. The analysis of social media includes Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. This analysis contributes to identifying how interactions in these forms of social media depend on the type of information shared. The results indicate that messages focused on fake health information are mostly aggressive, those based on evidence of social impact are respectful and transformative, and finally, deliberation contexts promoted in social media overcome false information about health. These results contribute to advancing knowledge in overcoming fake health-related news shared in social media.	2020	NA	International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health 2020, Vol. 17, Page 2430	17	7	2430-2430	NA	10.3390/IJERPH17072430	26499	#27413	Pulido 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/IJERPH17072430	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Journalism and Communication Studies, Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, Campus de la UAB, Pla√ßa C√≠vica, 08193 Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain|Department of Theory and History of Education, University of Barcelona, Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, 585, 08007 Barcelona, Spain	('Spain', 2)
Evidence that Vitamin D Supplementation Could Reduce Risk of Influenza and COVID-19 Infections and Deaths	Grant, William B.; Lahore, Henry; McDonnell, Sharon L.; Baggerly, Carole A.; French, Christine B.; Aliano, Jennifer L.; Bhattoa, Harjit P.	<p>The world is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed. This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration. To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40â€“60 ng/mL (100â€“150 nmol/L). For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D3 doses might be useful. Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.</p>	2020	NA	Nutrients	12	4	988-988	NA	10.3390/nu12040988	26497	#26898	Grant 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/nu12040988	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei Blvd 98, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary	('Hungary', 1)
Investigating a Serious Challenge in the Sustainable Development Process: Analysis of Confirmed cases of COVID-19 (New Type of Coronavirus) Through a Binary Classification Using Artificial Intelligence and Regression Analysis	Pirouz, Behrouz; Shaffiee Haghshenas, Sina; Shaffiee Haghshenas, Sami; Piro, Patrizia	<p>Nowadays, sustainable development is considered a key concept and solution in creating a promising and prosperous future for human societies. Nevertheless, there are some predicted and unpredicted problems that epidemic diseases are real and complex problems. Hence, in this research work, a serious challenge in the sustainable development process was investigated using the classification of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (new version of Coronavirus) as one of the epidemic diseases. Hence, binary classification modeling was used by the group method of data handling (GMDH) type of neural network as one of the artificial intelligence methods. For this purpose, the Hubei province in China was selected as a case study to construct the proposed model, and some important factors, namely maximum, minimum, and average daily temperature, the density of a city, relative humidity, and wind speed, were considered as the input dataset, and the number of confirmed cases was selected as the output dataset for 30 days. The proposed binary classification model provides higher performance capacity in predicting the confirmed cases. In addition, regression analysis has been done and the trend of confirmed cases compared with the fluctuations of daily weather parameters (wind, humidity, and average temperature). The results demonstrated that the relative humidity and maximum daily temperature had the highest impact on the confirmed cases. The relative humidity in the main case study, with an average of 77.9%, affected positively, and maximum daily temperature, with an average of 15.4 Â°C, affected negatively, the confirmed cases.</p>	2020	NA	Sustainability	12	6	2427-2427	NA	10.3390/su12062427	12296	#11274	Pirouz 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.3390/su12062427	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Mechanical, Energy and Management Engineering, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende, Italy|Department of Civil Engineering, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende, Italy	('Italy', 2)
Antiviral Action of Tryptanthrin Isolated from Strobilanthes cusia Leaf against Human Coronavirus NL63	Tsai, Y. C.; Lee, C. L.; Yen, H. R.; Chang, Y. S.; Lin, Y. P.; Huang, S. H.; Lin, C. W.	Strobilanthes cusia (Nees) Kuntze is a Chinese herbal medicine used in the treatment of respiratory virus infections. The methanol extract of S. cusia leaf contains chemical components such as Î²-sitosterol, indirubin, tryptanthrin, betulin, indigodole A, and indigodole B that have diverse biological activities. However, the antiviral action of S. cusia leaf and its components against human coronavirus remains to be elucidated. Human coronavirus NL63 infection is frequent among immunocompromised individuals, young children, and in the elderly. This study investigated the anti-Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) activity of the methanol extract of S. cusia leaf and its major components. The methanol extract of S. cusia leaf effectively inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) and virus yield (IC(50) = 0.64 Î¼g/mL) in HCoV-NL63-infected cells. Moreover, this extract potently inhibited the HCoV-NL63 infection in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the six components identified in the methanol extract of S. cusia leaf, tryptanthrin and indigodole B (5aR-ethyltryptanthrin) exhibited potent antiviral activity in reducing the CPE and progeny virus production. The IC(50) values against virus yield were 1.52 Î¼M and 2.60 Î¼M for tryptanthrin and indigodole B, respectively. Different modes of time-of-addition/removal assay indicated that tryptanthrin prevented the early and late stages of HCoV-NL63 replication, particularly by blocking viral RNA genome synthesis and papain-like protease 2 activity. Notably, tryptanthrin (IC(50) = 0.06 Î¼M) and indigodole B (IC(50) = 2.09 Î¼M) exhibited strong virucidal activity as well. This study identified tryptanthrin as the key active component of S. cusia leaf methanol extract that acted against HCoV-NL63 in a cell-type independent manner. The results specify that tryptanthrin possesses antiviral potential against HCoV-NL63 infection.	2020	NA	Biomolecules	10	3	NA	32120929	10.3390/biom10030366	13287	#13514	Tsai 2020	NA	Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Other related diseases and viruses; Virology, immunology	10.3390/biom10030366	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan|Department of Cosmeceutics, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan|Department of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40447, Taiwan|Department of Biotechnology, Asia University, Wufeng, Taichung 41354, Taiwan	('China', 3)

New Biophysical Approaches Reveal the Dynamics and Mechanics of Type I Viral Fusion Machinery and Their Interplay with Membranes	Benhaim, Mark A.; Lee, Kelly K.	Protein-mediated membrane fusion is a highly regulated biological process essential for cellular and organismal functions and infection by enveloped viruses. During viral entry the membrane fusion reaction is catalyzed by specialized protein machinery on the viral surface. These viral fusion proteins undergo a series of dramatic structural changes during membrane fusion where they engage, remodel, and ultimately fuse with the host membrane. The structural and dynamic nature of these conformational changes and their impact on the membranes have long-eluded characterization. Recent advances in structural and biophysical methodologies have enabled researchers to directly observe viral fusion proteins as they carry out their functions during membrane fusion. Here we review the structure and function of type I viral fusion proteins and mechanisms of protein-mediated membrane fusion. We highlight how recent technological advances and new biophysical approaches are providing unprecedented new insight into the membrane fusion reaction.	2020	NA	Viruses 2020, Vol. 12, Page 413	12	4	413-413	NA	10.3390/V12040413	45237	#42020	Benhaim 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/V12040413	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7610, USA	('USA', 1)

In a containment-based strategy, rapid, sensitive and specific testing is important in epidemiological control and clinical management. Using 96 SARS-CoV-2 and 104 non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genomes and our in-house program, GolayMetaMiner, four specific regions longer than 50 nucleotides in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were identified. Primers were designed to target the longest and previously untargeted nsp2 region and optimized as a probe-free real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The new COVID-19-nsp2 assay had a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.8 TCID50/mL and did not amplify other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory viruses. Assay reproducibility in terms of cycle threshold (Cp) values was satisfactory, with the total imprecision (% CV) values well below 5%. Evaluation of the new assay using 59 clinical specimens from 14 confirmed cases showed 100% concordance with our previously developed COVID-19-RdRp/Hel reference assay. A rapid, sensitive, SARS-CoV-2-specific real-time RT-PCR assay, COVID-19-nsp2, was developed.	2020	NA	International Journal of Molecular Sciences 2020, Vol. 21, Page 2574	21	7	2574-2574	NA	10.3390/IJMS21072574	45239	#42099	Yip 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/IJMS21072574	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Microbiology, Queen Mary Hospital, HKSAR, Hong Kong, China|Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, HKSAR, Hong Kong, China|Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518053, China|Department of Medicine, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, HKSAR, Hong Kong, China|Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, HKSAR, Hong Kong, China|Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, HKSAR, Hong Kong, China|Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, HKSAR, Hong Kong, China|Department of Medicine and Geriatrics, Princess Margaret Hospital, HKSAR, Hong Kong, China	('China', 8)
Bacteriophage Based Biosensors: Trends, Outcomes and Challenges	Aliakbar Ahovan, Zahra; Hashemi, Ali; De Plano, Laura Maria; Gholipourmalekabadi, Mazaher; Seifalian, Alexander	Foodborne pathogens are one of the main concerns in public health, which can have a serious impact on community health and health care systems. Contamination of foods by bacterial pathogens (such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella typhimurium) results in human infection. A typical example is the current issue with Coronavirus, which has the potential for foodborne transmission and ruling out such concerns is often difficult. Although, the possible dissemination of such viruses via the food chain has been raised. Standard bacterial detection methods require several hours or even days to obtain the results, and the delay may result in food poisoning to eventuate. Conventional biochemical and microbiological tests are expensive, complex, time-consuming and not always reliable. Therefore, there are urgent demands to develop simple, cheap, quick, sensitive, specific and reliable tests for the detection of these pathogens in foods. Recent advances in smart materials, nanomaterials and biomolecular modeling have been a quantum leap in the development of biosensors in overcoming the limitations of a conventional standard laboratory assay. This research aimed to critically review bacteriophage-based biosensors, used for the detection of foodborne pathogens, as well as their trends, outcomes and challenges are discussed. The future perspective in the use of simple and cheap biosensors is in the development of lab-on-chips, and its availability in every household to test the quality of their food.	2020	NA	Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)	10	3	E501-E501	NA	10.3390/nano10030501	8755	#8339	AliakbarAhovan 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/nano10030501	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 1985717443, Iran|Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, 98166 Messina, Italy|Department of Tissue Engineering & Regenerative Medicine, Faculty of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 1449614535, Iran	('Iran', 3)|('Italy', 1)
Role of Porcine Aminopeptidase N and Sialic Acids in Porcine Coronavirus Infections in Primary Porcine Enterocytes	Cui, Tingting; Theuns, Sebastiaan; Xie, Jiexiong; Broeck, Wim Van den; Nauwynck, Hans J.	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) have been reported to use aminopeptidase N (APN) as a cellular receptor. Recently, the role of APN as a receptor for PEDV has been questioned. In our study, the role of APN in PEDV and TGEV infections was studied in primary porcine enterocytes. After seven days of cultivation, 89% of enterocytes presented microvilli and showed a two- to five-fold higher susceptibility to PEDV and TGEV. A significant increase of PEDV and TGEV infection was correlated with a higher expression of APN, which was indicative that APN plays an important role in porcine coronavirus infections. However, PEDV and TGEV infected both APN positive and negative enterocytes. PEDV and TGEV Miller showed a higher infectivity in APN positive cells than in APN negative cells. In contrast, TGEV Purdue replicated better in APN negative cells. These results show that an additional receptor exists, different from APN for porcine coronaviruses. Subsequently, treatment of enterocytes with neuraminidase (NA) had no effect on infection efficiency of TGEV, implying that terminal cellular sialic acids (SAs) are no receptor determinants for TGEV. Treatment of TGEV with NA significantly enhanced the infection which shows that TGEV is masked by SAs.	2020	NA	Viruses 2020, Vol. 12, Page 402	12	4	402-402	NA	10.3390/V12040402	30648	#31709	Cui 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/V12040402	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Morphology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Salisburylaan 133, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium	('Belgium', 1)

Characteristics of and Public Health Responses to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak in China	Deng, Sheng-Qun; Peng, Hong-Juan	In December 2019, cases of unidentified pneumonia with a history of exposure in the Huanan Seafood Market were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified to be accountable for this disease. Human-to-human transmission is confirmed, and this disease (named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO)) spread rapidly around the country and the world. As of 18 February 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 75,199 with 2009 fatalities. The COVID-19 resulted in a much lower case-fatality rate (about 2.67%) among the confirmed cases, compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Among the symptom composition of the 45 fatality cases collected from the released official reports, the top four are fever, cough, short of breath, and chest tightness/pain. The major comorbidities of the fatality cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis. The source of the virus and the pathogenesis of this disease are still unconfirmed. No specific therapeutic drug has been found. The Chinese Government has initiated a level-1 public health response to prevent the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, it is also crucial to speed up the development of vaccines and drugs for treatment, which will enable us to defeat COVID-19 as soon as possible.	2020	NA	J Clin Med	9	2	E575	32093211	10.3390/jcm9020575	982	#1999	Deng 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.3390/jcm9020575	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Pathogen Biology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China	('China', 1)
Emergence of Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV: Need for Rapid Vaccine and Biologics Development	Shanmugaraj, Balamurugan; Malla, Ashwini; Phoolcharoen, Waranyoo	Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen that was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. This virus is responsible for the ongoing outbreak that causes severe respiratory illness and pneumonia-like infection in humans. Due to the increasing number of cases in China and outside China, the WHO declared coronavirus as a global health emergency. Nearly 35,000 cases were reported and at least 24 other countries or territories have reported coronavirus cases as early on as February. Inter-human transmission was reported in a few countries, including the United States. Neither an effective anti-viral nor a vaccine is currently available to treat this infection. As the virus is a newly emerging pathogen, many questions remain unanswered regarding the virus&rsquo;s reservoirs, pathogenesis, transmissibility, and much more is unknown. The collaborative efforts of researchers are needed to fill the knowledge gaps about this new virus, to develop the proper diagnostic tools, and effective treatment to combat this infection. Recent advancements in plant biotechnology proved that plants have the ability to produce vaccines or biopharmaceuticals rapidly in a short time. In this review, the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China, the need for rapid vaccine development, and the potential of a plant system for biopharmaceutical development are discussed.	2020	NA	Pathogens	9	2	NA	NA	10.3390/pathogens9020148	301	#1502	Shanmugaraj 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Vaccines	10.3390/pathogens9020148	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand	('Thailand', 1)
Short-term Forecasts of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China: February 13â€“23, 2020	Roosa, Kimberlyn; Lee, Yiseul; Luo, Ruiyan; Kirpich, Alexander; Rothenberg, Richard; Hyman, M. James; Yan, Ping; Chowell, Gerardo	The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic continues to spread within and outside of China, despite several social distancing measures implemented by the Chinese government. Limited epidemiological data are available, and recent changes in case definition and reporting further complicate our understanding of the impact of the epidemic, particularly in the epidemic&rsquo;s epicenter. Here we use previously validated phenomenological models to generate short-term forecasts of cumulative reported cases in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China. Using daily reported cumulative case data up until 13 February 2020 from the National Health Commission of China, we report 5- and 10-day ahead forecasts of cumulative case reports. Specifically, we generate forecasts using a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model, which have each been previously used to forecast outbreaks due to different infectious diseases. Forecasts from each of the models suggest the outbreaks may be nearing extinction in both Guangdong and Zhejiang; however, the sub-epidemic model predictions also include the potential for further sustained transmission, particularly in Zhejiang. Our 10-day forecasts across the three models predict an additional 65&ndash;81 cases (upper bounds: 169&ndash;507) in Guangdong and an additional 44&ndash;354 (upper bounds: 141&ndash;875) cases in Zhejiang by February 23, 2020. In the best-case scenario, current data suggest that transmission in both provinces is slowing down.	2020	NA	Journal of Clinical Medicine	9	2	NA	NA	10.3390/jcm9020596	300	#1506	Roosa 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.3390/jcm9020596	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Population Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30302, USA|Department of Mathematics, Center for Computational Science, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70118, USA	('USA', 2)|('Georgia', 1)
Systematic Comparison of Two Animal-to-Human Transmitted Human Coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV	Xu, Jiabao; Zhao, Shizhe; Teng, Tieshan; Abdalla, Abualgasim Elgaili; Zhu, Wan; Xie, Longxiang; Wang, Yunlong; Guo, Xiangqian	After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world in 2003, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause severe symptoms in respiratory tract infections. Recently, a new emerged HCoV isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as &ldquo;coronavirus disease 2019&rdquo; (COVID-19). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security. There are some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses. The goal of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.	2020	NA	Viruses	12	2	NA	NA	10.3390/v12020244	302	#1449	Xu 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Virology, immunology	10.3390/v12020244	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Preventive Medicine, Institute of Biomedical Informatics, Bioinformatics Center, Henan Provincial Engineering Center for Tumor Molecular Medicine, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China|Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Jouf University, Sakaka 2014, Saudi Arabia|Department of Anesthesia, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA	('China', 1)|('Saudi Arabia', 1)|('USA', 1)
Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence Technology for Novel Coronavirus Disease-19 Self-Testing	Mashamba-Thompson, Tivani P.; Crayton, Ellen Debra	<p>The novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading with a rising death toll and transmission rate reported in high income countries rather than in low income countries. The overburdened healthcare systems and poor disease surveillance systems in resource-limited settings may struggle to cope with this COVID-19 outbreak and this calls for a tailored strategic response for these settings. Here, we recommend a low cost blockchain and artificial intelligence-coupled self-testing and tracking systems for COVID-19 and other emerging infectious diseases. Prompt deployment and appropriate implementation of the proposed system have the potential to curb the transmissions of COVID-19 and the related mortalities, particularly in settings with poor access to laboratory infrastructure.</p>	2020	NA	Diagnostics	10	4	198-198	NA	10.3390/diagnostics10040198	25910	#23343	Mashamba-Thompson 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/diagnostics10040198	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Public Health, University of Limpopo, Polokwane, Limpopo Province 0727, South Africa	('South Africa', 1)
A Simulation on Potential Secondary Spread of Novel Coronavirus in an Exported Country Using a Stochastic Epidemic SEIR Model	Iwata, Kentaro; Miyakoshi, Chisato	Ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and the number of new patients continues to increase. Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world, such as other Asian countries, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China. Simulations using stochastic SEIR model were conducted, assuming one patient was imported to a community. Among 45 possible scenarios we prepared, the worst scenario resulted in the total number of persons recovered or removed to be 997 (95% CrI 990&ndash;1000) at day 100 and a maximum number of symptomatic infectious patients per day of 335 (95% CrI 232&ndash;478). Calculated mean basic reproductive number (R0) was 6.5 (Interquartile range, IQR 5.6&ndash;7.2). However, better case scenarios with different parameters led to no secondary cases. Altering parameters, especially time to hospital visit. could change the impact of a secondary outbreak. With these multiple scenarios with different parameters, healthcare professionals might be able to better prepare for this viral infection.	2020	NA	Journal of Clinical Medicine 2020, Vol. 9, Page 944	9	4	944-944	NA	10.3390/JCM9040944	19053	#19607	Iwata 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.3390/JCM9040944	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Research Support, Center for Clinical Research and Innovation, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Kobe 650-0047, Japan	('Japan', 1)
Master Regulator Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2/Human Interactome	Guzzi, Pietro H.; Mercatelli, Daniele; Ceraolo, Carmine; Giorgi, Federico M.	The recent epidemic outbreak of a novel human coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 causing the respiratory tract disease COVID-19 has reached worldwide resonance and a global effort is being undertaken to characterize the molecular features and evolutionary origins of this virus. In this paper, we set out to shed light on the SARS-CoV-2/host receptor recognition, a crucial factor for successful virus infection. Based on the current knowledge of the interactome between SARS-CoV-2 and host cell proteins, we performed Master Regulator Analysis to detect which parts of the human interactome are most affected by the infection. We detected, amongst others, affected apoptotic and mitochondrial mechanisms, and a downregulation of the ACE2 protein receptor, notions that can be used to develop specific therapies against this new virus.	2020	NA	Journal of Clinical Medicine 2020, Vol. 9, Page 982	9	4	982-982	NA	10.3390/JCM9040982	25909	#23517	Guzzi 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/JCM9040982	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Surgical and Medical Science, University of Catanzaro, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy|Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy	('Italy', 2)
Exploring the Relevance of Senotherapeutics for the Current SARS-CoV-2 Emergency and Similar Future Global Health Threats	Malavolta, Marco; Giacconi, Robertina; Brunetti, Dario; Provinciali, Mauro; Maggi, Fabrizio	The higher death rate caused by COVID-19 in older people, especially those with comorbidities, is a challenge for biomedical aging research. Here we explore the idea that an exacerbated inflammatory response, in particular that mediated by IL-6, may drive the deleterious consequences of the infection. Data shows that other RNA viruses, such as influenza virus, can display enhanced replication efficiency in senescent cells, suggesting that the accumulation of senescent cells with aging and age-related diseases may play a role in this phenomenon. However, at present, we are completely unaware of the response to SARS-CoV and SARS-COV-2 occurring in senescent cells. We deem that this is a priority area of research because it could lead to the development of several therapeutic strategies based on senotherapeutics or prevent unsuccessful attempts. Two of these senotherapeutics, azithromycin and ruxolitinib, are currently undergoing testing for their efficacy in treating COVID-19. The potential of these strategies is not only for ameliorating the consequences of the current emergence of SARS-CoV-2, but also for the future emergence of new viruses or mutated ones for which we are completely unprepared and for which no vaccines are available.	2020	NA	Cells 2020, Vol. 9, Page 909	9	4	909-909	NA	10.3390/CELLS9040909	45235	#42137	Malavolta 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/CELLS9040909	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Translational Research, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy	('Italy', 1)
Eco-Virological Preliminary Study of Potentially Emerging Pathogens in Hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) Recovered at a Wildlife Treatment and Rehabilitation Center in Northern Italy	Delogu, M.; Cotti, C.; Lelli, D.; Sozzi, E.; Trogu, T.; Lavazza, A.; Garuti, G.; Castrucci, M. R.; Vaccari, G.; De Marco, M. A.; Moreno, A.	The Western European Hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is one of the four hedgehog species belonging to the genus Erinaceus. Among them, E. amurensis is extant in East Asia's areas only, whereas E. europaeus, E. roumanicus and E. concolor are mainly found in Europe. E. europaeus is endemically distributed from western to central and southern Europe, including Italy. Western European hedgehogs' ecological and feeding habits, along with their high population densities, notable synanthropic attitudes, frequent contacts with sympatric wild and domestic species, including humans, implicate the possible involvement of E. europaeus in the ecology of potentially emerging viruses, such as coronaviruses, influenza A and influenza D viruses, canine distemper virus, pestiviruses and Aujeszky's disease virus. We examined 24 E. europaeus individuals found injured in urban and rural areas of Northern Italy. Of the 24 fecal samples collected and tested for the above-mentioned pathogens by both PCR-based and virus isolation methods, 14 were found PCR-positive for betacoronaviruses belonging to lineage C and related to the known Erinaceus coronaviruses (EriCoVs), as determined by partial sequencing of the virus genome. Our findings suggest that hedgehogs could be considered natural reservoirs of CoVs, and also act as chronic shedding carriers of these potentially emerging RNA viruses.	2020	NA	Animals : an open access journal from MDPI	10	3	NA	32121543	10.3390/ani10030407	14041	#12341	Delogu 2020	NA	Other related diseases and viruses; Reservoir	10.3390/ani10030407	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Department of Veterinary Medical Sciences, University of Bologna, 50 Via Tolara di Sopra, 40064 Ozzano dell‚ÄôEmilia (BO), Italy|Department of Infectious Diseases, Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†, 299 Viale Regina Elena, 00161 Rome, Italy|Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†, 299 Viale Regina Elena, 00161 Rome, Italy	('Italy', 3)

Immediate Psychological Responses and Associated Factors during the Initial Stage of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic among the General Population in China	Wang, Cuiyan; Pan, Riyu; Wan, Xiaoyang; Tan, Yilin; Xu, Linkang; Ho, S. Cyrus; Ho, C. Roger	Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience. Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20&ndash;24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.	2020	NA	International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health	17	5	NA	NA	10.3390/ijerph17051729	5756	#5504	Wang 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Ethics, social science, economics	10.3390/ijerph17051729	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Education, Huaibei Normal University, Huaibei 235000, China|Department of Psychological Medicine, National University Health System, Kent Ridge 119228, Singapore|Department of Psychological Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge 119228, Singapore|Institute of Health Innovation and Technology (iHealthtech), National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge 119077, Singapore	('Singapore', 5)|('China', 1)
Ostwald Growth Rate in Controlled Covid-19 Epidemic Spreading as in Arrested Growth in Quantum Complex Matter	Bianconi, Antonio; Marcelli, Augusto; Campi, Gaetano; Perali, Andrea	<p>Here, we focus on the data analysis of the growth of epidemic spread of Covid-19 in countries where different policies of containment were activated. It is known that the growth of pandemic spread at its threshold is exponential, but it is not known how to quantify the success of different containment policies. We identify that a successful approach gives an arrested phase regime following the Ostwald growth, where, over the course of time, one phase transforms into another metastable phase with a similar free energy as observed in oxygen interstitial diffusion in quantum complex matter and in crystallization of proteins. We introduce the s factor which provides a quantitative measure of the efficiency and speed of the adopted containment policy, which is very helpful not only to monitor the Covid-19 pandemic spread but also for other countries to choose the best containment policy. The results show that a policy based on joint confinement, targeted tests, and tracking positive cases is the most rapid pandemic containment policy; in fact, we found values of 9, 5, and 31 for the success s factor for China, South Korea, and Italy, respectively, where the lowest s factor indicates the best containment policy.</p>	2020	NA	Condensed Matter	5	2	23-23	NA	10.3390/condmat5020023	17623	#17943	Bianconi 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.3390/condmat5020023	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Institute of Crystallography, CNR, via Salaria Km 29. 300, Monterotondo Stazione, I-00016 Rome, Italy	('Italy', 1)
Suspending Classes Without Stopping Learning: Chinaâ€™s Education Emergency Management Policy in the COVID-19 Outbreak	Zhang, Wunong; Wang, Yuxin; Yang, Lili; Wang, Chuanyi	Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 outbreak, an emergency policy initiative called &ldquo;Suspending Classes Without Stopping Learning&rdquo; was launched by the Chinese government to continue teaching activities as schools across the country were closed to contain the virus. However, there is ambiguity and disagreement about what to teach, how to teach, the workload of teachers and students, the teaching environment, and the implications for education equity. Possible difficulties that the policy faces include: the weakness of the online teaching infrastructure, the inexperience of teachers (including unequal learning outcomes caused by teachers&rsquo; varied experience), the information gap, the complex environment at home, and so forth. To tackle the problems, we suggest that the government needs to further promote the construction of the educational information superhighway, consider equipping teachers and students with standardized home-based teaching/learning equipment, conduct online teacher training, include the development of massive online education in the national strategic plan, and support academic research into online education, especially education to help students with online learning difficulties.	2020	NA	Journal of Risk and Financial Management 2020, Vol. 13, Page 55	13	3	55-55	NA	10.3390/JRFM13030055	8822	#8541	Zhang 2020	NA	* Normative guidance; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Ethics, social science, economics	10.3390/JRFM13030055	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Institute of Education, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100091, China	('China', 1)
In Silico Discovery of Candidate Drugs against Covid-19	Cava, Claudia; Bertoli, Gloria; Castiglioni, Isabella	Previous studies reported that Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main cell receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. It plays a key role in the access of the virus into the cell to produce the final infection. In the present study we investigated in silico the basic mechanism of ACE2 in the lung and provided evidences for new potentially effective drugs for Covid-19. Specifically, we used the gene expression profiles from public datasets including The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus and Genotype-Tissue Expression, Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analysis to investigate the main functions of ACE2-correlated genes. We constructed a protein-protein interaction network containing the genes co-expressed with ACE2. Finally, we focused on the genes in the network that are already associated with known drugs and evaluated their role for a potential treatment of Covid-19. Our results demonstrate that the genes correlated with ACE2 are mainly enriched in the sterol biosynthetic process, Aryldialkylphosphatase activity, adenosylhomocysteinase activity, trialkylsulfonium hydrolase activity, acetate-CoA and CoA ligase activity. We identified a network of 193 genes, 222 interactions and 36 potential drugs that could have a crucial role. Among possible interesting drugs for Covid-19 treatment, we found Nimesulide, Fluticasone Propionate, Thiabendazole, Photofrin, Didanosine and Flutamide.	2020	NA	Viruses 2020, Vol. 12, Page 404	12	4	404-404	NA	10.3390/V12040404	34270	#35034	Cava 2020	NA	NA	10.3390/V12040404	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Institute of Molecular Bioimaging and Physiology, National Research Council (IBFM-CNR), Via F.Cervi 93, 20090 Segrate-Milan, Milan, Italy|Department of Physics ‚ÄúGiuseppe Occhialini‚Äù, University of Milan-Bicocca Piazza dell‚ÄôAteneo Nuovo, 1 - 20126, Milan, Italy	('Italy', 2)
The Impact of COVID-19 Epidemic Declaration on Psychological Consequences: A Study on Active Weibo Users	Li, Sijia; Wang, Yilin; Xue, Jia; Zhao, Nan; Zhu, Tingshao	<p>COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) has significantly resulted in a large number of psychological consequences. The aim of this study is to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on peopleâ€™s mental health, to assist policy makers to develop actionable policies, and help clinical practitioners (e.g., social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists) provide timely services to affected populations. We sample and analyze the Weibo posts from 17,865 active Weibo users using the approach of Online Ecological Recognition (OER) based on several machine-learning predictive models. We calculated word frequency, scores of emotional indicators (e.g., anxiety, depression, indignation, and Oxford happiness) and cognitive indicators (e.g., social risk judgment and life satisfaction) from the collected data. The sentiment analysis and the paired sample t-test were performed to examine the differences in the same group before and after the declaration of COVID-19 on 20 January, 2020. The results showed that negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, depression and indignation) and sensitivity to social risks increased, while the scores of positive emotions (e.g., Oxford happiness) and life satisfaction decreased. People were concerned more about their health and family, while less about leisure and friends. The results contribute to the knowledge gaps of short-term individual changes in psychological conditions after the outbreak. It may provide references for policy makers to plan and fight against COVID-19 effectively by improving stability of popular feelings and urgently prepare clinical practitioners to deliver corresponding therapy foundations for the risk groups and affected people.</p>	2020	NA	International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health	17	6	2032-2032	NA	10.3390/ijerph17062032	10204	#10504	Li 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Ethics, social science, economics	10.3390/ijerph17062032	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China|Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China|Department of Psychology, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China	('China', 3)
Effective Risk Communication for Public Health Emergency: Reflection on the COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Outbreak in Wuhan, China	Zhang, Liwei; Li, Huijie; Chen, Kelin	Risk communication is critical to emergency management. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the effective process and attention points of risk communication reflecting on the COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan, China. We provide the timeline of risk communication progress in Wuhan and use a message-centered approach to identify problems that it entailed. It was found that the delayed decision making of the local government officials and the limited information disclosure should be mainly responsible for the ineffective risk communication. The principles for effective risk communication concerning Wuhan&rsquo;s outbreak management were also discussed. The whole communication process is suggested to integrate the accessibility and openness of risk information, the timing and frequency of communication, and the strategies dealing with uncertainties. Based on these principles and lessons from Wuhan&rsquo;s case, this paper employed a simplified Government&ndash;Expert&ndash;Public risk communication model to illustrate a collaborative network for effective risk communication.	2020	NA	Healthcare 2020, Vol. 8, Page 64	8	1	64-64	NA	10.3390/HEALTHCARE8010064	12292	#11122	Zhang 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Epidemiology; Ethics, social science, economics	10.3390/HEALTHCARE8010064	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|Institute of Urban Governance, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, China	('China', 1)
Bat Coronaviruses in China	Fan, Yi; Zhao, Kai; Shi, Zheng-Li; Zhou, Peng	During the past two decades, three zoonotic coronaviruses have been identified as the cause of large-scale disease outbreaksâ»Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome (SADS). SARS and MERS emerged in 2003 and 2012, respectively, and caused a worldwide pandemic that claimed thousands of human lives, while SADS struck the swine industry in 2017. They have common characteristics, such as they are all highly pathogenic to humans or livestock, their agents originated from bats, and two of them originated in China. Thus, it is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China. Therefore, the investigation of bat coronaviruses becomes an urgent issue for the detection of early warning signs, which in turn minimizes the impact of such future outbreaks in China. The purpose of the review is to summarize the current knowledge on viral diversity, reservoir hosts, and the geographical distributions of bat coronaviruses in China, and eventually we aim to predict virus hotspots and their cross-species transmission potential.	2019	NA	Viruses	11	3	210	30832341	10.3390/v11030210	914	#1401	Fan 2019	NA	* Narrative review; Epidemiology; Other related diseases and viruses; Reservoir; Virology, immunology	10.3390/v11030210	Institutional Open Access Program|Institutional Open Access Program|University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China	('China', 1)
Annual review of virology seasonality of respiratory viral infections	Moriyama, M.; Hugentobler, W. J.; Iwasaki, A.	The seasonal cycle of respiratory viral diseases has been widely recognized for thousands of years, as annual epidemics of the common cold and influenza disease hit the human population like clockwork in the winter season in temperate regions. Moreover, epidemics caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 occur during the winter months. The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory viral infections have been examined and debated for many years. The two major contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters and human behavior. Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on respiratory virus stability and transmission rates. More recent research highlights the importance of the environmental factors, especially temperature and humidity, in modulating host intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses to viral infections in the respiratory tract. Here we review evidence of how outdoor and indoor climates are linked to the seasonality of viral respiratory infections. We further discuss determinants of host response in the seasonality of respiratory viruses by highlighting recent studies in the field.	2020	NA	Annual Review of Virology	7	NA	NA	NA	10.1146/annurev-virology-012420-022445	34524	#35145	Moriyama 2020	NA	NA	10.1146/annurev-virology-012420-022445	Institutional Pricing|Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA; email: |Institute of Primary Care|University of Zurich and University Hospital|Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, 	('USA', 1)

The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory viral infections have been examined and debated for many years. The two major contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters and human behavior. Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on respiratory virus stability and transmission rates. More recent research highlights the importance of the environmental factors, especially temperature and humidity, in modulating host intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses to viral infections in the respiratory tract. Here we review evidence of how outdoor and indoor climates are linked to the seasonality of viral respiratory infections. We further discuss determinants of host response in the seasonality of respiratory viruses by highlighting recent studies in the field. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Virology, Volume 7 is September 29, 2020.

Ocular manifestations of a hospitalised patient with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus disease	Chen, Lu; Liu, Meizhou; Zhang, Zheng; Qiao, Kun; Huang, Ting; Chen, Miaohong; Xin, Na; Huang, Zuliang; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Guoming; Wang, Jiantao	PURPOSE: To report the ocular characteristics and the presence of viral RNA of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in conjunctival swab specimens in a patient with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). PARTICIPANT AND METHODS: A 30-year-old man with confirmed COVID-19 and bilateral acute conjunctivitis which occurred 13 days after illness onset. Based on detailed ophthalmic examination, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in conjunctival swabs. The ocular characteristics, presence of viral RNA and viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival specimens were evaluated. RESULTS: Slit lamp examination showed bilateral acute follicular conjunctivitis. RT-PCR assay demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in conjunctival specimen 13 days after onset (cycle threshold value: 31). The conjunctival swab specimens remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 14 and 17 days after onset. On day 19, RT-PCR result was negative for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 is capable of causing ocular complications such as viral conjunctivitis in the middle phase of illness. Precautionary measures are recommended when examining infected patients throughout the clinical course of the infection. However, conjunctival sampling might not be useful for early diagnosis because the virus may not appear initially in the conjunctiva.	2020	NA	The British journal of ophthalmology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-316304	45149	#42143	Chen 2020	NA	NA	10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-316304	Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study and we strictly followed the Declaration of Helsinki in all procedures.

Cardiovascular Implications of Fatal Outcomes of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)	Guo, Tao; Fan, Yongzhen; Chen, Ming; Wu, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Lin; He, Tao; Wang, Hairong; Wan, Jing; Wang, Xinghuan; Lu, Zhibing	Importance Increasing numbers of confirmed cases and mortality rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are occurring in several countries and continents. Information regarding the impact of cardiovascular complication on fatal outcome is scarce. Objective To evaluate the association of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective single-center case series analyzed patients with COVID-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China, from January 23, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Analysis began February 25, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, and treatments were collected and analyzed in patients with and without elevation of troponin T (TnT) levels. Result Among 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 144 patients (77%) were discharged and 43 patients (23%) died. The mean (SD) age was 58.50 (14.66) years. Overall, 66 (35.3%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels. The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 13.33% (4 of 30) for those with underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD but elevated TnT levels, and 69.44% (25 of 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnTs. Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels compared with the patients without CVD (36 [54.5%] vs 16 [13.2%]). Plasma TnT levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (Î² = 0.530, P < .001) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (Î² = 0.613, P < .001). Plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [IQR], 0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [IQR], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (P = .001; P < .001), while no significant dynamic changes of TnT (median [IQR], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and NT-proBNP (median [IQR], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (P = .96; P = .16). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2%] vs 69 [51.1%]) and mechanical ventilation (41 [59.6%] vs 14 [10.4%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels. The mortality rates of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% (7 of 19) and 25.6% (43 of 168). Conclusions and Relevance Myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable. Myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury. Aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury.	2020	NA	JAMA cardiology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017	17613	#17624	Guo 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017	Institutions / Librarians|Department of Cardiology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Department of Urology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Institutions|Institutions & Librarians	('China', 2)

Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients With 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China	Wang, Dawei; Hu, Bo; Hu, Chang; Zhu, Fangfang; Liu, Xing; Zhang, Jing; Wang, Binbin; Xiang, Hui; Cheng, Zhenshun; Xiong, Yong; Zhao, Yan; Li, Yirong; Wang, Xinghuan; Peng, Zhiyong	IMPORTANCE: In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. EXPOSURES: Documented NCIP. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. RESULTS: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8â€‰Ã—â€‰109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (nâ€‰=â€‰36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (nâ€‰=â€‰102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (nâ€‰=â€‰47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.	2020	NA	JAMA	NA	NA	10.1001/jama.2020.1585	32031570	10.1001/jama.2020.1585	498	#537	Wang 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1001/jama.2020.1585	Institutions / Librarians|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Emergency Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Department of Urology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China|Institutions|Institutions & Librarians	('China', 6)

Diagnostic Testing for the Novel Coronavirus	Sharfstein, Joshua M.; Becker, Scott J.; Mello, Michelle M.	Controversies over diagnostic testing have dominated US headlines about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Technical challenges with the first test developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) left the nation with minimal diagnostic capacity during the first few weeks of the epidemic. The CDC also initially limited access to testing to a narrow group of individuals with known exposure. The delayed discovery of a case of COVID-19 in California, followed quickly by evidence of community transmission in multiple states, revealed the shortcomings of this strategy. In the early stages, COVID-19 has spread beyond the nationâ€™s ability to detect it.	2020	NA	JAMA	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1001/jama.2020.3864	5841	#5635	Sharfstein 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1001/jama.2020.3864	Institutions / Librarians|Department of Health Policy and Management, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland|Institutions|Institutions & Librarians	NA
COVID-19 in Singaporeâ€”Current Experience: Critical Global Issues That Require Attention and Action	Wong, John E. L.; Leo, Yee Sin; Tan, Chorh Chuan	On December 31, 2019, China informed the World Health Organization of a novel viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei Province. Singapore is an independent city-state 3400 km (2125 miles) from Wuhan, but as a major air hub had an average of 330â€¯000 visitor arrivals from China each month in 2019. On January 2, 2020, Singaporeâ€™s Ministry of Health alerted all physicians to identify any patient with pneumonia and a recent travel history to Wuhan. On January 3, Singapore started temperature screening at its airport of all travelers arriving from Wuhan. Researchers in China identified a novel coronavirus as the causative agent on January 9, the genetic sequence was released on January 12, and human transmission to health care workers was confirmed on January 20.	2020	NA	JAMA	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1001/jama.2020.2467	944	#1353	Wong 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Epidemiology; Ethics, social science, economics; Infection prevention and control	10.1001/jama.2020.2467	Institutions / Librarians|Department of Hematology‚ÄìMedical Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System, Singapore|Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore|Institutions|Institutions & Librarians	('Singapore', 3)
COVID-19â€”New Insights on a Rapidly Changing Epidemic	del Rio, Carlos; Malani, Preeti N.	Since first reported in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus now known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has spread globally. As of February 27, 2020, more than 82â€¯000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) and 2800 deaths have been reported, of which approximately 95% of cases and 97% of deaths are in China. Cases have now been reported in 49 other countries. A particularly large outbreak occurred among the passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where more than 700 infections are reported.	2020	NA	JAMA	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1001/jama.2020.3072	2531	#2788	delRio 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Epidemiology	10.1001/jama.2020.3072	Institutions / Librarians|Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia|Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor|Institutions|Institutions & Librarians	('Georgia', 1)

Characteristics of Ocular Findings of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei Province, China	Wu, Ping; Duan, Fang; Luo, Chunhua; Liu, Qiang; Qu, Xingguang; Liang, Liang; Wu, Kaili	Importance. While the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in more than 100â€¯000 infected individuals in China and worldwide, there are few reports on the association of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with ocular abnormalities. Understanding ocular manifestations of patients with COVID-19 by ophthalmologists and others may facilitate the diagnosis and prevention of transmission of the disease.ObjectiveTo investigate ocular manifestations and viral prevalence in the conjunctiva of patients with COVID-19.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsIn this case series, patients with COVID-19 treated from February 9 to 15, 2020, at a hospital center in Hubei province, China, were retrospectively reviewed for ocular manifestations. During the period of treatment, the ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and reverse transcriptaseâ€“polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed.Main Outcomes and MeasuresOcular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.ResultsOf the 38 included patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, 25 (65.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 65.8 (16.6) years. Among them, 28 patients (73.7%) had positive findings for COVID-19 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and of these, 2 patients (5.2%) yielded positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 in their conjunctival as well as nasopharyngeal specimens. A total of 12 of 38 patients (31.6%; 95% CI, 17.5-48.7) had ocular manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions. By univariate analysis, patients with ocular symptoms were more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms. In addition, 11 of 12 patients with ocular abnormalities (91.7%; 95% CI, 61.5-99.8) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Of these, 2 (16.7%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from both conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs.Conclusions and RelevanceIn this study, one-third of patients with COVID-19 had ocular abnormalities, which frequently occurred in patients with more severe COVID-19. Although there is a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in tears, it is possible to transmit via the eyes.	2020	NA	JAMA Ophthalmology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.1291	21013	#20527	Wu 2020	NA	NA	10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.1291	Institutions / Librarians|Department of Ophthalmology, The First College of Clinical Medical Science, Yichang Central People‚Äôs Hospital, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China|Institutions|Institutions & Librarians	('China', 2)

Sample Pooling as a Strategy to Detect Community Transmission of SARS-CoV-2	Hogan, Catherine A.; Sahoo, Malaya K.; Pinsky, Benjamin A.	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed the global importance of robust diagnostic testing to differentiate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from other routine respiratory infections and guide appropriate clinical management. Given the limited testing capacity available in the United States early in the pandemic, individuals with a clinical syndrome consistent with COVID-19, but without travel or exposure history, were not tested. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether there may have been community circulation of SARS-CoV-2 prior to the identification of individuals with positive results through standard public health surveillance. Sample pooling, a strategy used for community monitoring of other infectious diseases such as trachoma, has not, to our knowledge, been deployed for the early comprehensive screening of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.	2020	NA	JAMA	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1001/jama.2020.5445	34269	#34960	Hogan 2020	NA	NA	10.1001/jama.2020.5445	Institutions / Librarians|Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California|Institutions|Institutions & Librarians	NA
Critical Care Utilization for the COVID-19 Outbreak in Lombardy, Italy	Grasselli, Giacomo; Pesenti, Antonio; Cecconi, Maurizio	On February 20, 2020, a patient in his 30s admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Codogno Hospital (Lodi, Lombardy, Italy) tested positive for a new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). He had a history of atypical pneumonia that was not responding to treatment, but he was not considered at risk for COVID-19 infection.1 The positive result was immediately reported to the Lombardy health care system and governmental offices. During the next 24 hours, the number of reported positive cases increased to 36. This situation was considered a serious development for several reasons: the patient (â€œpatient 1â€) was healthy and young; in less than 24 hours, 36 additional cases were identified, without links to patient 1 or previously identified positive cases already in the country; it was not possible to identify with certainty the source of transmission to patient 1 at the time; and, because patient 1 was in the ICU and there were already 36 cases by day 2, chances were that a cluster of unknown magnitude was present and additional spread was likely. On February 21, an emergency task force was formed by the Government of Lombardy and local health authorities to lead the response to the outbreak. This Viewpoint provides a summary of the response of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU network and a forecast of estimated ICU demand over the coming weeks (projected to March 20, 2020).	2020	NA	JAMA	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1001/jama.2020.4031	8828	#8387	Grasselli 2020	NA	* Normative guidance; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1001/jama.2020.4031	Institutions / Librarians|Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, University of Milan, Italy|Institutions|Institutions & Librarians	('Italy', 1)

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) emerged in China and has spread globally, creating a pandemic. Information about the clinical characteristics of infected patients who require intensive care is limited. Objective. To characterize patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) in the Lombardy region of Italy. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>Retrospective case series of 1591 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 referred for ICU admission to the coordinator center (Fondazione IRCCS Caâ€™ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy) of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network and treated at one of the ICUs of the 72 hospitals in this network between February 20 and March 18, 2020. Date of final follow-up was March 25, 2020.</p><h3>Exposures</h3><p>SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptaseâ€“polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swabs.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>Demographic and clinical data were collected, including data on clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality. Data were recorded by the coordinator center on an electronic worksheet during telephone calls by the staff of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Of the 1591 patients included in the study, the median (IQR) age was 63 (56-70) years and 1304 (82%) were male. Of the 1043 patients with available data, 709 (68%) had at least 1 comorbidity and 509 (49%) had hypertension. Among 1300 patients with available respiratory support data, 1287 (99% [95% CI, 98%-99%]) needed respiratory support, including 1150 (88% [95% CI, 87%-90%]) who received mechanical ventilation and 137 (11% [95% CI, 9%-12%]) who received noninvasive ventilation. The median positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 14 (IQR, 12-16) cm H<sub>2</sub>O, and Fio<sub>2</sub>was greater than 50% in 89% of patients. The median Pao<sub>2</sub>/Fio<sub>2</sub>was 160 (IQR, 114-220).

Risk Factors Associated With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Death in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia in Wuhan, China	Wu, Chaomin; Chen, Xiaoyan; Cai, Yanping; Xia, Jia'an; Zhou, Xing; Xu, Sha; Huang, Hanping; Zhang, Li; Zhou, Xia; Du, Chunling; Zhang, Yuye; Song, Juan; Wang, Sijiao; Chao, Yencheng; Yang, Zeyong; Xu, Jie; Zhou, Xin; Chen, Dechang; Xiong, Weining; Xu, Lei; Zhou, Feng; Jiang, Jinjun; Bai, Chunxue; Zheng, Junhua; Song, Yuanlin	Importance Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has subsequently spread worldwide. Risk factors for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia have not yet been well delineated. Objective To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or died. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study of 201 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China between December 25, 2019, and January 26, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 13, 2020. Exposures Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Main Outcomes and Measures The development of ARDS and death. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed. Results Of 201 patients, the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7%) patients were men. Eighty-four patients (41.8%) developed ARDS, and of those 84 patients, 44 (52.4%) died. In those who developed ARDS, compared with those who did not, more patients presented with dyspnea (50 of 84 [59.5%] patients and 30 of 117 [25.6%] patients, respectively [difference, 33.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%]) and had comorbidities such as hypertension (23 of 84 [27.4%] patients and 16 of 117 [13.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-26.1%]) and diabetes (16 of 84 [19.0%] patients and 6 of 117 [5.1%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%]). In bivariate Cox regression analysis, risk factors associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.26; 95% CI 2.08-5.11; and HR, 6.17; 95% CI, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; and HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, respectively]). High fever (â‰¥39 Â°C) was associated with higher likelihood of ARDS development (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82). Among patients with ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72). Conclusions and Relevance Older age was associated with greater risk of development of ARDS and death likely owing to less rigorous immune response. Although high fever was associated with the development of ARDS, it was also associated with better outcomes among patients with ARDS. Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ARDS.	2020	NA	JAMA internal medicine	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.0994	8827	#8523	Wu 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.0994	Institutions / Librarians|Department of Pulmonary Medicine, QingPu Branch of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, China|Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China|Department of Anesthesiology, International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China|Department of Infectious Diseases, Fengxian Guhua Hospital, Shanghai, China|Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China|Department of Respiratory Medicine, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China|Department of Emergency Medicine, Shanghai Pudong New Area Gongli Hospital, Shanghai, China|Department of Urology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China|Institutions|Institutions & Librarians	('China', 9)
SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Patients With Cancer at a Tertiary Care Hospital in Wuhan, China	Yu, Jing; Ouyang, Wen; Chua, Melvin L. K.; Xie, Conghua	In December 2019, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei, which has been linked to the severe adult respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission from droplet contamination.1,2 A report of 138 hospitalized patients from a single institution (Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University) indicated that hospital-acquired transmission accounted for 41.3% of these admitted patients, thus implicating the hospital environment as a source of spread of the virus.3 Patients with cancer are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and monitoring, and hence, they may be at risk of contracting COVID-19. Moreover, cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are immunosuppressive. Here, we report the incidence and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients who were treated at a tertiary cancer institution in Wuhan. Methods We reviewed the medical records, including demographic, clinical, and treatment data of 1524 patients with cancer who were admitted to the Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, from December 30, 2019, to February 17, 2020 (data cutoff date). COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed based on the updated COVID-19 Diagnostic Criteria, 5th Edition (Supplement). Outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with cancer were reported. This retrospective study was approved by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University ethics committee (2020039). Waiver of informed consent was approved for the aggregated data; verbal informed consent was obtained from the living patients with COVID-19. Results We estimated the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with cancer from our single institution at 0.79% (12 of 1524 patients; 95% CI, 0.3%-1.2%). This was higher than the cumulative incidence of all diagnosed COVID-19 cases that was reported in the city of Wuhan over the same time period (0.37%; 41â€¯152 of 11â€¯081â€¯000 cases; data cutoff on February 17, 2020). Clinical details on the cancer diagnoses and treatment history are summarized in Table 1. The median age of infected patients was 66 years (range, 48 to 78 years); 8 of 12 patients (66.7%) were older than 60 years. Seven of 12 (58.3%) patients had nonâ€“small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Five (41.7%) were being treated with either chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy (nâ€‰=â€‰3) or radiotherapy (nâ€‰=â€‰2). Three patients (25.0%) developed SARS; 1 patient required intensive-level care. As of March 10, 2020, 6 patients (50.0%) had been discharged, whereas 3 deaths (25.0%) were recorded. We also interrogated the association of SARS-Cov-2 infection with age and concurrent NSCLC diagnosis. Of the 1524 patients with cancer who were screened, 228 had NSCLC. We found that patients with NSCLC older than 60 years had a higher incidence of COVID-19 than those aged 60 years or younger (4.3% vs 1.8%) (Table 2). Discussion It is hypothesized that patients with cancer may be susceptible to an infection during a viral epidemic owing to their immunocompromised status.4 This study highlights the following observations: patients with cancer from the epicenter of a viral epidemic harbored a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.89-3.02) compared with the community. However, fewer than half of these infected patients were undergoing active treatment for their cancers. Next, we observed that older patients (>60 years) and patients with NSCLC may be at risk of COVID-19. Nonetheless, a population study of 1099 patients with COVID-19 did not indicate that age was associated with susceptibility to infection.5 A larger sample size in patients with cancer will resolve these potential associations. Finally, our findings imply that hospital admission and recurrent hospital visits are potential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose that aggressive measures be undertaken to reduce frequency of hospital visits of patients with cancer during a viral epidemic going forward. For patients who require treatment, proper isolation protocols must be in place to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.	2020	NA	JAMA Oncology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.0980	15913	#15394	Yu 2020	NA	* Case study/series; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.0980	Institutions / Librarians|Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, People‚Äôs Republic of China|Institutions|Institutions & Librarians	('China', 1)

Response to COVID-19 in Taiwan	Wang, C. Jason; Ng, Chun Y.; Brook, Robert H.	Taiwan is 81 miles off the coast of mainland China and was expected to have the second highest number of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to its proximity to and number of flights between China.1 The country has 23 million citizens of which 850 000 reside in and 404 000 work in China.2,3 In 2019, 2.71 million visitors from the mainland traveled to Taiwan.4 As such, Taiwan has been on constant alert and ready to act on epidemics arising from China ever since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003. Given the continual spread of COVID-19 around the world, understanding the action items that were implemented quickly in Taiwan and assessing the effectiveness of these actions in preventing a large-scale epidemic may be instructive for other countries. COVID-19 occurred just before the Lunar New Year during which time millions of Chinese and Taiwanese were expected to travel for the holidays. Taiwan quickly mobilized and instituted specific approaches for case identification, containment, and resource allocation to protect the public health. Taiwan leveraged its national health insurance database and integrated it with its immigration and customs database to begin the creation of big data for analytics; it generated real-time alerts during a clinical visit based on travel history and clinical symptoms to aid case identification. It also used new technology, including QR code scanning and online reporting of travel history and health symptoms to classify travelersâ€™ infectious risks based on flight origin and travel history in the past 14 days. Persons with low risk (no travel to level 3 alert areas) were sent a health declaration border pass via SMS (short message service) messaging to their phones for faster immigration clearance; those with higher risk (recent travel to level 3 alert areas) were quarantined at home and tracked through their mobile phone to ensure that they remained at home during the incubation period. Moreover, Taiwan enhanced COVID-19 case finding by proactively seeking out patients with severe respiratory symptoms (based on information from the National Health Insurance [NHI] database) who had tested negative for influenza and retested them for COVID-19; 1 was found of 113 cases. The toll-free number 1922 served as a hotline for citizens to report suspicious symptoms or cases in themselves or others; as the disease progressed, this hotline has reached full capacity, so each major city was asked to create its own hotline as an alternative. It is not known how often this hotline has been used. The government addressed the issue of disease stigma and compassion for those affected by providing food, frequent health checks, and encouragement for those under quarantine. This rapid response included hundreds of action items (eTable in the Supplement).	2020	NA	JAMA	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1001/jama.2020.3151	4913	#5505	Wang 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1001/jama.2020.3151	Institutions / Librarians|Departments of Pediatrics, Medicine, and Health Research and Policy, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California|Institutions|Institutions & Librarians	NA

Findings on chest radiography were normal. There was no evidence of obstructive coronary disease on coronary angiography. Based on the COVID-19 outbreak, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed, with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcriptaseâ€“polymerase chain reaction assay. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed increased wall thickness with diffuse biventricular hypokinesis, especially in the apical segments, and severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%). Short tau inversion recovery and T2-mapping sequences showed marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema, and there was also diffuse late gadolinium enhancement involving the entire biventricular wall. There was a circumferential pericardial effusion that was most notable around the right cardiac chambers. These findings were all consistent with acute myopericarditis.

Safety Recommendations for Evaluation and Surgery of the Head and Neck During the COVID-19 Pandemic	Givi, Babak; Schiff, Bradley A.; Chinn, Steven B.; Clayburgh, Daniel; Iyer, N. Gopalakrishna; Jalisi, Scharukh; Moore, Michael G.; Nathan, Cherie-Ann; Orloff, Lisa A.; Oâ€™Neill, James P.; Parker, Noah; Zender, Chad; Morris, Luc G. T.; Davies, Louise	ImportanceThe rapidly expanding novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has challenged the medical community to an unprecedented degree. Physicians and health care workers are at added risk of exposure and infection during the course of patient care. Because of the rapid spread of this disease through respiratory droplets, health care workers who come in close contact with the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as otolaryngologistsâ€“head and neck surgeons, are particularly at risk. A set of safety recommendations was created based on a review of the literature and communications with physicians with firsthand knowledge of safety procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.ObservationsA high number of health care workers were infected during the first phase of the pandemic in the city of Wuhan, China. Subsequently, by adopting strict safety precautions, other regions were able to achieve high levels of safety for health care workers without jeopardizing the care of patients. The most common procedures related to the examination and treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases were reviewed. Each category was reviewed based on the potential risk imposed to health care workers. Specific recommendations were made based on the literature, when available, or consensus best practices. Specific safety recommendations were made for performing tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19.Conclusions and RelevancePreserving a highly skilled health care workforce is a top priority for any community and health care system. Based on the experience of health care systems in Asia and Europe, by following strict safety guidelines, the risk of exposure and infection of health care workers could be greatly reduced while providing high levels of care. The provided recommendations, which may evolve over time, could be used as broad guidance for all health care workers who are involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.	2020	NA	JAMA Otolaryngologyâ€“Head & Neck Surgery	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1001/jamaoto.2020.0780	21011	#20526	Givi 2020	NA	NA	10.1001/jamaoto.2020.0780	Institutions / Librarians|Institute of Medicine. |Department of Otolaryngology, NYU Langone Health, New York, New York|Department of Otolaryngology, Montefiore Medical Center, New York, New York|Department of Otolaryngology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor|Department of Otolaryngology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland|Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Singapore General Hospital and National Cancer Centre, Singapore|Department of Otolaryngology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts|Department of Otolaryngology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis|Department of Otolaryngology, Louisiana State University, Shreveport|Department of Otolaryngology, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California|Department of Otolaryngology, Beaumont Hospital, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland|Department of Otolaryngology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio|Department of Veterans Affairs, White River Junction, Vermont|Institute of Medicine. |Institutions|Institutions & Librarians	('Singapore', 2)|('India', 2)|('Ireland', 2)|('Israel', 1)

Potential Effects of Coronaviruses on the Cardiovascular System: A Review	Madjid, Mohammad; Safavi-Naeini, Payam; Solomon, Scott D.; Vardeny, Orly	Importance Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached a pandemic level. Coronaviruses are known to affect the cardiovascular system. We review the basics of coronaviruses, with a focus on COVID-19, along with their effects on the cardiovascular system. Observations Coronavirus disease 2019 can cause a viral pneumonia with additional extrapulmonary manifestations and complications. A large proportion of patients have underlying cardiovascular disease and/or cardiac risk factors.

Emergency Restructuring of a General Surgery Residency Program During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: The University of Washington Experience	Nassar, Amer H.; Zern, Nicole K.; McIntyre, Lisa K.; Lynge, Dana; Smith, Caitlin A.; Petersen, Rebecca P.; Horvath, Karen D.; Wood, Douglas E.	Seattle, Washington, is an epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in the United States. In response, the Division of General Surgery at the University of Washington Department of Surgery in Seattle has designed and implemented an emergency restructuring of the facility's general surgery resident care teams in an attempt to optimize workforce well-being, comply with physical distancing requirements, and continue excellent patient care. This article introduces a unique approach to general surgery resident allocation by dividing patient care into separate inpatient care, operating care, and clinic care teams. Separate teams made up of all resident levels will work in each setting for a 1-week period. By creating this emergency structure, we have limited the number of surgery residents with direct patient contact and have created teams working in isolation from one another to optimize physical distancing while still performing required work. This also provides a resident reserve without exposure to the virus, theoretically flattening the curve among our general surgery resident cohort. Surgical resident team restructuring is critical during a pandemic to optimize patient care and ensure the well-being and vitality of the resident workforce while ensuring the entire workforce is not compromised.	2020	NA	JAMA surgery	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1001/jamasurg.2020.1219	37838	#38769	Nassar 2020	NA	NA	10.1001/jamasurg.2020.1219	Institutions / Librarians|University of Wisconsin Blueprint for Restructuring a Surgery Department During the COVID-19 Pandemic|Department of Surgery, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle|University of Wisconsin Blueprint for Restructuring a Surgery Department During the COVID-19 Pandemic|Institutions|Institutions & Librarians	NA

Protected Code Stroke: Hyperacute Stroke Management During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic	Khosravani, Houman; Rajendram, Phavalan; Notario, Lowyl; Chapman, Martin G.; Menon, Bijoy K.	Background and Purpose- Hyperacute assessment and management of patients with stroke, termed code stroke, is a time-sensitive and high-stakes clinical scenario. In the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ability to deliver timely and efficacious care must be balanced with the risk of infectious exposure to the clinical team. Furthermore, rapid and effective stroke care remains paramount to achieve maximal functional recovery for those needing admission and to triage care appropriately for those who may be presenting with neurological symptoms but have an alternative diagnosis. Methods- Available resources, COVID-19-specific infection prevention and control recommendations, and expert consensus were used to identify clinical screening criteria for patients and provide the required nuanced considerations for the healthcare team, thereby modifying the conventional code stroke processes to achieve a protected designation. Results- A protected code stroke algorithm was developed. Features specific to prenotification and clinical status of the patient were used to define precode screening. These include primary infectious symptoms, clinical, and examination features. A focused framework was then developed with regard to a protected code stroke. We outline the specifics of personal protective equipment use and considerations thereof including aspects of crisis resource management impacting team role designation and human performance factors during a protected code stroke. Conclusions- We introduce the concept of a protected code stroke during a pandemic, as in the case of COVID-19, and provide a framework for key considerations including screening, personal protective equipment, and crisis resource management. These considerations and suggested algorithms can be utilized and adapted for local practice.	2020	NA	Stroke	NA	NA	STROKEAHA120029838-STROKEAHA120029838	NA	10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.029838	26536	#26794	Khosravani 2020	NA	NA	10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.029838	Institutions/Librarians FAQ|Department of Critical Care Medicine, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto, Canada (M.G.C.) |Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Radiology, and Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine and the Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Canada (B.K.M.). |Institutions/Librarians FAQ|Institutions/Librarians FAQ	('Canada', 2)

Temporary Emergency Guidance to US Stroke Centers During the COVID-19 Pandemic	Leadership, Aha Asa Stroke Council	During this unprecedented time of extraordinary stress on the US healthcare system, the AHA/ASA Stroke Councilâ€”as individuals in our localities and together as an entity at the national levelâ€”acknowledge the mounting concern regarding optimal stroke care during the COVID-19 pandemic among vascular neurologists and those clinicians who care for patients with stroke. We therefore seek to provide guidance for the care of stroke patients in the midst of the crisis. Ordinarily, national recommendations go through a rigorous process of development, refinement, peer review, and thoughtful promulgation. None of that is possible at this time, yet we believe there is a substantial need for a broad policy statement that reflects both the commonality of the pandemic across the US and the individual variability necessary at local sites. We issue this temporary statement as an interim stopgap opinion, pending a more thorough and considered process.	2020	NA	Stroke	NA	NA	STROKEAHA.120.030023-STROKEAHA.120.030023	NA	10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.030023	26535	#26793	Leadership 2020	NA	NA	10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.030023	Institutions/Librarians FAQ|Institutions/Librarians FAQ|Institutions/Librarians FAQ	NA
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2: SARS-CoV-2 Receptor and Regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin System	Gheblawi, Mahmoud; Wang, Kaiming; Viveiros, Anissa; Nguyen, Quynh; Zhong, Jiu-Chang; Turner, Anthony J.; Raizada, Mohan K.; Grant, Maria B.; Oudit, Gavin Y.	Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) has a multiplicity of physiological roles that revolve around its trivalent function: a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), facilitator of amino acid transport, and the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 receptor. ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue. ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for COVID-19, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease. Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing. The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes. The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications. Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1-7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated RAS. Recombinant human ACE2 has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively. Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the RAS, together with implications for the COVID-19 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.	2020	NA	Circulation research	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.317015	45124	#42135	Gheblawi 2020	NA	NA	10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.317015	Institutions/Librarians FAQ|Institutions/Librarians FAQ|Institutions/Librarians FAQ	NA

Nucleocapsid Protein Recruitment to Replication-Transcription Complexes Plays a Crucial Role in Coronaviral Life Cycle	Cong, Yingying; Ulasli, Mustafa; Schepers, Hein; Mauthe, Mario; Vâ€™kovski, Philip; Kriegenburg, Franziska; Thiel, Volker; de Haan, Cornelis A. M.; Reggiori, Fulvio	Coronavirus (CoV) nucleocapsid (N) proteins are key for incorporating genomic RNA into progeny viral particles. In infected cells, N proteins are present at the replication-transcription complexes (RTCs), the sites of CoV RNA synthesis. It has been shown that N proteins are important for viral replication and that the one of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a commonly used model CoV, interacts with nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), a component of the RTCs. These two aspects of the CoV life cycle, however, have not been linked. We found that the MHV N protein binds exclusively to nsp3 and not other RTC components by using a systematic yeast two-hybrid approach, and we identified two distinct regions in the N protein that redundantly mediate this interaction. A selective N protein variant carrying point mutations in these two regions fails to bind nsp3 in vitro, resulting in inhibition of its recruitment to RTCs in vivo. Furthermore, in contrast to the wild-type N protein, this N protein variant impairs the stimulation of genomic RNA and viral mRNA transcription in vivo and in vitro, which in turn leads to impairment of MHV replication and progeny production. Altogether, our results show that N protein recruitment to RTCs, via binding to nsp3, is an essential step in the CoV life cycle because it is critical for optimal viral RNA synthesis.IMPORTANCE CoVs have long been regarded as relatively harmless pathogens for humans. Severe respiratory tract infection outbreaks caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV, however, have caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in humans. These outbreaks highlighted the relevance of being able to control CoV infections. We used a model CoV, MHV, to investigate the importance of the recruitment of N protein, a central component of CoV virions, to intracellular platforms where CoVs replicate, transcribe, and translate their genomes. By identifying the principal binding partner at these intracellular platforms and generating a specific mutant, we found that N protein recruitment to these locations is crucial for promoting viral RNA synthesis. Moreover, blocking this recruitment strongly inhibits viral infection. Thus, our results explain an important aspect of the CoV life cycle and reveal an interaction of viral proteins that could be targeted in antiviral therapies.	2020	NA	Journal of Virology	94	4	e01925-19	NA	10.1128/JVI.01925-19	1468	#2317	Cong 2020	NA	Other related diseases and viruses; Virology, immunology	10.1128/JVI.01925-19	Institutions|Institutions|Department of Biomedical Sciences of Cells and Systems, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands|Department of Cell Biology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands|Department of Biomedical Sciences of Cells and Systems, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands|Department of Biomedical Sciences of Cells and Systems, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands|Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland|Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathobiology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland|Department of Biomedical Sciences of Cells and Systems, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands|Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland|Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathobiology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland|Department of Biomedical Sciences of Cells and Systems, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands|Department of Cell Biology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands|University of Kentucky College of Medicine	('Netherlands', 7)|('Switzerland', 4)|('ucky', 1)

Among 273 specimens from 15 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 77 (28.2%) were positive by both the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and RdRp-P2 assays. The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for an additional 42 RdRd-P2-negative specimens [119/273 (43.6%) vs 77/273 (28.2%), P<0.001], including 29/120 (24.2%) respiratory tract specimens and 13/153 (8.5%) non-respiratory tract specimens. The mean viral load of these specimens was 3.21*104 RNA copies/ml (range, 2.21*102 to 4.71*105 RNA copies/ml). The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay did not cross-react with other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens in cell culture and clinical specimens, whereas the RdRp-P2 assay cross-reacted with SARS-CoV in cell culture. The highly sensitive and specific COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.	2020	NA	Journal of clinical microbiology	NA	NA	NA	MEDLINE:32132196	10.1128/jcm.00310-20	5074	#5099	Chan 2020	NA	* Comparative study, RCT; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1128/jcm.00310-20	Institutions|Institutions|Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China.|Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|Department of Microbiology, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China.|Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|Department of Medicine, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|Department of Microbiology, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|Department of Microbiology, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|Department of Medicine and Geriatrics, Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.|Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China.|Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.

Comparative Performance of SARS-CoV-2 Detection Assays using Seven Different Primer/Probe Sets and One Assay Kit	Nalla, Arun K.; Casto, Amanda M.; Huang, Meei-Li W.; Perchetti, Garrett A.; Sampoleo, Reigran; Shrestha, Lasata; Wei, Yulun; Zhu, Haiying; Jerome, Keith R.; Greninger, Alexander L.	<p> Nearly 400,000 people worldwide are known to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 beginning in December 2019. The virus has now spread to over 168 countries including the United States, where the first cluster of cases was observed in the Seattle metropolitan area in Washington. Given the rapid increase in the number of cases in many localities, the availability of accurate, high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing is vital to efforts to manage the current public health crisis. In the course of optimizing SARS-CoV-2 testing performed by the University of Washington Clinical Virology Lab (UW Virology Lab), we evaluated assays using seven different primer/probe sets and one assay kit. We found that the most sensitive assays were those that used the E-gene primer/probe set described by Corman et al. (Eurosurveillance 25 (3), 2020, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" href="https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045">https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045</ext-link> ) and the N2 set developed by the CDC (Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.pdf">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.pdf</ext-link> ). All assays tested were found to be highly specific for SARS-CoV-2, with no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses observed in our analyses regardless of the primer/probe set or kit used. These results will provide valuable information to other clinical laboratories who are actively developing SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols at a time when increased testing capacity is urgently needed worldwide. </p>	2020	NA	Journal of Clinical Microbiology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1128/JCM.00557-20	45241	#42093	Nalla 2020	NA	NA	10.1128/JCM.00557-20	Institutions|Institutions|Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA|Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA|Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA|Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA|Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA|Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA|Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA|Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA|Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA|Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA	NA

Coronavirus Endoribonuclease and Deubiquitinating Interferon Antagonists Differentially Modulate the Host Response during Replication in Macrophages	Volk, Aaron; Hackbart, Matthew; Deng, Xufang; Cruz-Pulido, Yazmin; O'Brien, Amornrat; Baker, Susan C.	Coronaviruses encode multiple interferon antagonists that modulate the host response to virus replication. Here, we evaluated the host transcriptional response to infection with murine coronaviruses encoding independent mutations in one of two different viral antagonists: the deubiquitinase (DUB) within nonstructural protein 3 or the endoribonuclease (EndoU) within nonstructural protein 15. We used transcriptomics approaches to compare the scope and kinetics of the host response to the wild-type, DUBmut, and EndoUmut viruses in infected macrophages. We found that the EndoUmut virus activates a focused response predominantly involving type I interferons and interferon-related genes, whereas the WT and DUBmut viruses more broadly stimulate upregulation of over 2,800 genes, including networks associated with activating the unfolded protein response (UPR), and the proinflammatory response associated with viral pathogenesis. This study highlights the role of viral interferon antagonists in shaping the kinetics and magnitude of the host response during virus infection and demonstrates that inactivating a dominant viral antagonist, the coronavirus endoribonuclease, dramatically alters the host response in macrophages.ImportanceMacrophages are an important cell type during coronavirus infections because they "notice" the infection and respond by inducing type I interferons, which limits virus replication. In turn, coronaviruses encode proteins that mitigate the cell's ability to signal an interferon response. Here, we evaluated the host macrophage response to two independent mutant coronaviruses: one with reduced deubiquitinating activity (DUBmut) and the other containing an inactivated endoribonuclease (EndoUmut). We observed a rapid, robust, and focused response to the EndoUmut virus, which was characterized by enhanced expression of interferon and interferon-related genes. In contrast, wild-type virus and the DUBmut virus elicited a more limited interferon response and ultimately activated over 2,800 genes, including players in the unfolded protein response and pro-inflammatory pathways associated with progression of significant disease. This study reveals that EndoU activity substantially contributes to the ability of coronaviruses to evade the host innate response and to replicate in macrophages.	2020	NA	Journal of virology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1128/JVI.00178-20	10253	#9937	Volk 2020	NA	Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Virology, immunology	10.1128/JVI.00178-20	Institutions|Institutions|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL 60153|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL 60153|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL 60153|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL 60153|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL 60153|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL 60153	NA
Structure-Guided Mutagenesis Alters Deubiquitinating Activity and Attenuates Pathogenesis of a Murine Coronavirus	Deng, Xufang; Chen, Yafang; Mielech, Anna M.; Hackbart, Matthew; Kesely, Kristina R.; Mettelman, Robert C.; O'Brien, Amornrat; Chapman, Mackenzie E.; Mesecar, Andrew D.; Baker, Susan C.	Coronaviruses express a multifunctional papain-like protease, termed PLP2. PLP2 acts as a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies implicated PLP2 DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly as the wild-type virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to the wild-type virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post-infection, albeit both wild-type and DUBmut virus infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of PLP2-ubiquitin complex, and that PLP2 DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune response. The coronavirus papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain possesses protease activity, which cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and also DUB activity (de-conjugating ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like molecules from modified substrates) using identical catalytic residues. To separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin-binding. We found that mutating the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and exhibited reduced replication in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2/DUB is an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses.	2020	NA	Journal of virology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1128/JVI.01734-19	10254	#10361	Deng 2020	NA	Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Other related diseases and viruses	10.1128/JVI.01734-19	Institutions|Institutions|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL|Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL|Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL|Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN|Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN|Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL	NA
Trypsin Treatment Unlocks Barrier for Zoonotic Bat Coronavirus Infection	Menachery, Vineet D.; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Yount, Boyd L.; McAnarney, Eileen T.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Hale, Andrew; Graham, Rachel L.; Scobey, Trevor; Anthony, Simon J.; Wang, Lingshu; Graham, Barney; Randell, Scott H.; Lipkin, W. Ian; Baric, Ralph S.	Traditionally, the emergence of coronaviruses (CoVs) has been attributed to a gain in receptor binding in a new host. Our previous work with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like viruses argued that bats already harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming host restriction of two Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show that the bat virus spike can mediate the infection of human gut cells but is unable to infect human lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera. Finally, we found that the addition of exogenous trypsin also rescues HKU5-CoV, a second bat group 2c CoV. Together, these results indicate that proteolytic cleavage of the spike, not receptor binding, is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2c CoVs. Coupled with receptor binding, proteolytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate the emergence potential of bat CoVs and offers a means to recover previously unrecoverable zoonotic CoV strains.IMPORTANCE Overall, our studies demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage is the primary barrier to infection for a subset of zoonotic coronaviruses. Moving forward, the results argue that both receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage of the spike are critical factors that must be considered for evaluating the emergence potential and risk posed by zoonotic coronaviruses. In addition, the findings also offer a novel means to recover previously uncultivable zoonotic coronavirus strains and argue that other tissues, including the digestive tract, could be a site for future coronavirus emergence events in humans.	2020	NA	Journal of Virology	94	5	e01774-19	NA	10.1128/JVI.01774-19	1465	#2167	Menachery 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Other related diseases and viruses; Virology, immunology	10.1128/JVI.01774-19	Institutions|Institutions|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA|Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA|Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York|Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, and Marsico Lung Institute/Cystic Fibrosis Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York|Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA	('USA', 13)
The Laboratory Diagnosis of COVID-19 Infection: Current Issues and Challenges	Tang, Yi-Wei; Schmitz, Jonathan E.; Persing, David H.; Stratton, Charles W.	The COVID-19 outbreak has had a major impact on clinical microbiology laboratories in the past several months. This commentary covers current issues and challenges for the laboratory diagnosis of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2. In the pre-analytical stage, collecting the proper respiratory tract specimen at the right time from the right anatomic site is essential for a prompt and accurate molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. Appropriate measures are required to keep laboratory staff safe while producing reliable test results. In the analytic stage, real-time RT-PCR assays remain the molecular test of choice for the etiologic diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection while antibody-based techniques are being introduced as supplemental tools. In the postanalytical stage, testing results should be carefully interpreted using both molecular and serological findings. Finally, random access, integrated devices available at the point of care with scalable capacities will facilitate the rapid and accurate diagnosis and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infections and greatly assist in the control of this outbreak.	2020	NA	Journal of clinical microbiology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1128/JCM.00512-20	30602	#31026	Tang 2020	NA	NA	10.1128/JCM.00512-20	Institutions|Institutions|Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA|Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA	('USA', 2)
Computational inference of selection underlying the evolution of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2	Cagliani, Rachele; Forni, Diego; Clerici, Mario; Sironi, Manuela	<p> The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) recently emerged in China is thought to have a bat origin, as its closest known relative (BatCoV RaTG13) was described in horseshoe bats. We analyzed the selective events that accompanied the divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13. To this aim, we applied a population genetics-phylogenetics approach, which leverages within-population variation and divergence from an outgroup. Results indicated that most sites in the viral ORFs evolved under strong to moderate purifying selection. The most constrained sequences corresponded to some non-structural proteins (nsps) and to the M protein. Conversely, nsp1 and accessory ORFs, particularly ORF8, had a non-negligible proportion of codons evolving under very weak purifying selection or close to selective neutrality. Overall, limited evidence of positive selection was detected. The 6 <italic>bona fide</italic> positively selected sites were located in the N protein, in ORF8, and in nsp1. A signal of positive selection was also detected in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein but most likely resulted from a recombination event that involved the BatCoV RaTG13 sequence. In line with previous data, we suggest that the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13 encoded/encodes an RBM similar to that observed in SARS-CoV-2 itself and in some pangolin viruses. It is presently unknown whether the common ancestor still exists and which animals it infects. Our data however indicate that divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13 was accompanied by limited episodes of positive selection, suggesting that the common ancestor of the two viruses was poised for human infection. </p>	2020	NA	Journal of Virology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1128/JVI.00411-20	25884	#23681	Cagliani 2020	NA	NA	10.1128/JVI.00411-20	Institutions|Institutions|Department of Physiopathology and Transplantation, University of Milan, Milan, Italy	('Italy', 1)
The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), their biology and therapeutic options	Khan, Suliman; Siddique, Rabeea; Shereen, Muhammad Adnan; Ali, Ashaq; Liu, Jianbo; Bai, Qian; Bashir, Nadia; Xue, Mengzhou	The new decade of the 21 st century (2020) started with the emergence of novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 that caused an epidemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. It is the third highly pathogenic and transmissible coronavirus after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in humans. The source of origin, transmission to humans and mechanisms associated with the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 are not clear yet, however, its resemblance with SARS-CoV and several other bat coronaviruses was recently confirmed through genome sequencing related studies. The development of therapeutic strategies is necessary in order to prevent further epidemics and cure infected people. In this Review, we summarize current information about the emergence, origin, diversity, and epidemiology of three pathogenic coronaviruses with a specific focus on the current outbreak in Wuhan, China. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical features and potential therapeutic options that may be effective against SARS-CoV-2.	2020	NA	Journal of Clinical Microbiology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1128/JCM.00187-20	6921	#7146	Khan 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Vaccines; Virology, immunology	10.1128/JCM.00187-20	Institutions|Institutions|Department of Respiratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University.

Molecular mechanism for antibody-dependent enhancement of coronavirus entry	Wan, Y.; Shang, J.; Sun, S.; Tai, W.; Chen, J.; Geng, Q.; He, L.; Chen, Y.; Wu, J.; Shi, Z.; Zhou, Y.; Du, L.; Li, F.	Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry has been a major concern for epidemiology, vaccine development and antibody-based drug therapy. However, the molecular mechanism behind ADE is still elusive. Coronavirus spike protein mediates viral entry into cells by first binding to a receptor on host cell surface and then fusing viral and host membranes. Here we investigated how a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb), which targets the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS coronavirus spike, mediates viral entry using pseudovirus entry and biochemical assays. Our results showed that mAb binds to the virus-surface spike, allowing it to undergo conformational changes and become prone to proteolytic activation. Meanwhile, mAb binds to cell-surface IgG Fc receptor, guiding viral entry through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways. Our data suggest that the antibody/Fc-receptor complex functionally mimics viral receptor in mediating viral entry. Moreover, we characterized mAb dosages in viral-receptor-dependent, antibody-dependent, and both-receptors-dependent entry pathways, delineating guidelines on mAb usages in treating viral infections. Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism for antibody-enhanced viral entry and can guide future vaccination and antiviral strategies.Significance Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry has been observed for many viruses. It was shown that antibodies target one serotype of viruses but only sub-neutralize another, leading to ADE of the latter viruses. Here we identify a novel mechanism for ADE: a neutralizing antibody binds to the virus-surface spike protein of coronaviruses like a viral receptor, triggers a conformational change of the spike, and mediates viral entry into IgG-Fc-receptor-expressing cells through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways. We further evaluated how antibody dosages impacted viral entry into cells expressing viral receptor, Fc receptor, or both receptors. This study reveals complex roles of antibodies in viral entry and can guide future vaccine design and antibody-based drug therapy.	2019	NA	Journal of virology	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1128/JVI.02015-19	15	#10	Wan 2019	NA	Other related diseases and viruses; Virology, immunology	10.1128/JVI.02015-19	Institutions|Institutions|Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA|Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA|Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA|Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA|Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA	('USA', 5)
Molecular Mechanism for Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Coronavirus Entry	Wan, Yushun; Shang, Jian; Sun, Shihui; Tai, Wanbo; Chen, Jing; Geng, Qibin; He, Lei; Chen, Yuehong; Wu, Jianming; Shi, Zhengli; Zhou, Yusen; Du, Lanying; Li, Fang	Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry has been a major concern for epidemiology, vaccine development, and antibody-based drug therapy. However, the molecular mechanism behind ADE is still elusive. Coronavirus spike protein mediates viral entry into cells by first binding to a receptor on the host cell surface and then fusing viral and host membranes. In this study, we investigated how a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb), which targets the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus spike, mediates viral entry using pseudovirus entry and biochemical assays. Our results showed that MAb binds to the virus surface spike, allowing it to undergo conformational changes and become prone to proteolytic activation. Meanwhile, MAb binds to cell surface IgG Fc receptor, guiding viral entry through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways. Our data suggest that the antibody/Fc-receptor complex functionally mimics viral receptor in mediating viral entry. Moreover, we characterized MAb dosages in viral-receptor-dependent, Fc-receptor-dependent, and both-receptors-dependent viral entry pathways, delineating guidelines on MAb usages in treating viral infections. Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism for antibody-enhanced viral entry and can guide future vaccination and antiviral strategies.IMPORTANCE Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry has been observed for many viruses. It was shown that antibodies target one serotype of viruses but only subneutralize another, leading to ADE of the latter viruses. Here we identify a novel mechanism for ADE: a neutralizing antibody binds to the surface spike protein of coronaviruses like a viral receptor, triggers a conformational change of the spike, and mediates viral entry into IgG Fc receptor-expressing cells through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways. We further evaluated how antibody dosages impacted viral entry into cells expressing viral receptor, Fc receptor, or both receptors. This study reveals complex roles of antibodies in viral entry and can guide future vaccine design and antibody-based drug therapy.	2020	NA	Journal of Virology	94	5	e02015-19	NA	10.1128/JVI.02015-19	19	#908	Wan 2020	NA	NA	10.1128/JVI.02015-19	Institutions|Institutions|Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA|Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA|Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA|Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA|Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA	('USA', 5)
Receptor Recognition by the Novel Coronavirus from Wuhan: an Analysis Based on Decade-Long Structural Studies of SARS Coronavirus	Wan, Y.; Shang, J.; Graham, R.; Baric, R. S.; Li, F.	Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged from Wuhan, China, causing symptoms in humans similar to those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. Here, we analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV. First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV's capacity for human cell infection. Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission. Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections. These analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV and may help epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV.IMPORTANCE The recent emergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) puts the world on alert. 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003.

One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses. Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV. This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.	2020	NA	Journal of virology	94	7	NA	31996437	10.1128/jvi.00127-20	13868	#13107	Wan 2020	NA	Reservoir; Virology, immunology	10.1128/jvi.00127-20	Institutions|Institutions|Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA|Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA|Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA	('USA', 5)

Mitigating the impact of conference and travel cancellations on researchers' futures	Weissgerber, T.; Bediako, Y.; de Winde, C. M.; Ebrahimi, H.; Fernandez-Chiappe, F.; Ilangovan, V.; Mehta, D.; Paz Quezada, C.; Riley, J. L.; Saladi, S. M.; Sarabipour, S.; Tay, A.	The need to protect public health during the current COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated conference cancellations on an unprecedented scale. As the scientific community adapts to new working conditions, it is important to recognize that some of our actions may disproportionately affect early-career researchers and scientists from countries with limited research funding. We encourage all conference organizers, funders and institutions who are able to do so to consider how they can mitigate the unintended consequences of conference and travel cancellations and we provide seven recommendations for how this could be achieved. The proposed solutions may also offer long-term benefits for those who normally cannot attend conferences, and thus lead to a more equitable future for generations of researchers.	2020	NA	eLife	9	NA	NA	32216872	10.7554/eLife.57032	18633	#18593	Weissgerber 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Epidemiology; Ethics, social science, economics	10.7554/eLife.57032	Instituto de Investigaci√≥n en Biomedicina de Buenos Aires - CONICET - Partner Institute of the Max Planck Society, Argentina|Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Canada|Department of Botany and Zoology, Stellenbosch University, South Africa|Department of Biology, Dalhousie University, Canada|Institute for Computational Medicine and the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, United States|Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore|Institutions could help cover remaining expenses|Institutions can help by reimbursing ECRs for expenses that will not be covered by conference organizers or funding agencies. ECRs who paid in advance may find that registration fees will not be refunded, that their funding agency or travel grant will not allow reimbursement, or that their travel arrangements cannot be canceled. Institutions may also consider offering advances to ECRs who are awaiting refunds or reimbursement from conference organizers, travel providers and funding agencies. Obtaining refunds may be a lengthy process, as many organizations lack clear policies and staff to handle large-scale cancellations. Providing advances on refunds and reimbursements will reduce stress and financial hardships for ECRs with limited resources.

Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that these lncRNAs might be involved in numerous biological processes. Clustering analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs showed that 454 annotated and 376 novel lncRNAs were regulated after PDCoV infection. Furthermore, we constructed a lncRNA-protein-coding gene co-expression interaction network. The KEGG analysis of the co-expressed genes showed that these differentially expressed lncRNAs were enriched in pathways related to metabolism and TNF signaling.

En ese contexto, en nuestro pais, una zona de relevancia epidemiologica es la amazonia peruana, debido a la distribucion de enfermedades endemicas como las enfermedades metaxenicas (Dengue, Malaria entre otras), en donde el problema se incrementa debido a que la infeccion por COVID-19 puede llevar a falsos positivos en las pruebas de cribado para Dengue. Conllevando de esa forma a un retraso en el diagnostico de la infeccion por COVID-19 y una mayor diseminacion del virus, debido a que en la mayor parte de los casos de Dengue no se presentan signos de alarma y el tratamiento es ambulatorio.

Estimating the Unreported Number of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Cases in China in the First Half of January 2020: A Data-Driven Modelling Analysis of the Early Outbreak Risk Management Analysis for Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China	Zhao, Shi; Musa, Salihu S.; Lin, Qianying; Ran, Jinjun; Yang, Guangpu; Wang, Weiming; Lou, Yijun; Yang, Lin; Gao, Daozhou; He, Daihai; Wang, Maggie H.; Yue, Xiao-Guang; Shao, Xue-Feng; Li, Y. Rita; Crabbe, James C. M.; Mi, Lili; Hu, Siyan; Baker, S. Julien; Liang, Gang	Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries. The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0. Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern. The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403&minus;540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18&minus;25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average. We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49&minus;2.63). Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation. Recently, a novel coronavirus pneumonia (2019&ndash;nCoV) outbreak occurred in Wuhan, China, rapidly spreading first to the whole country, and then globally, causing widespread concern. From the perspectives of early warning and identification of risk, risk monitoring, and analysis, as well as risk management and handling, we propose corresponding solutions and recommendations, which include institutional cooperation, and to inform national and international policy-makers.	2020	NA	Journal of Clinical Medicine	9	2	NA	NA	10.3390/jcm9020388 10.3390/jrfm13020022	387	#158	Zhao 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology	10.3390/jcm9020388	JC School of Public Health and Primary Care, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong 999077, China | Shenzhen Research Institute of Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen 518060, China | Michigan Institute for Data Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, MI 48104, USA | School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong 999077, China | Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong 999077, China|SH Ho Scoliosis Research Lab, Joint Scoliosis Research Center of Chinese University of Hong Kong and Nanjing University, Hong Kong 999077, China | School of Mathematics and Statistics, Huaiyin Normal University, Huaian 223300, China \ School of Nursing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong 999077, China | Department of Mathematics, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China	('China', 8)|('USA', 1)

Facing the COVID-19 outbreak: What should we know and what could we do?	Yang, Yi; Shang, Weilong; Rao, Xiancai	A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019 and caused a serious type of pneumonia called coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. This epidemic quickly spread across China and extended to more than 20 other countries. This commentary discusses the reasons for the fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 in three aspects: the infectious sources, including the biological nature of the virus; the susceptible population; and the transmission routes. The current situations and suggestions regarding the control of the disease are summarized. This article is protected by copyright.

The psychological effects of quarantining a city	Rubin, G. James; Wessely, Simon	Whether the epidemiological benefits of mandatory mass quarantine outweigh the psychological costs is a judgement that should not be made lightlyThe emergence of a novel form of coronavirus in Wuhan, China, is creating a confused and rapidly evolving situation. As ever in the early stages of a major incident, facts are unclear. Weâ€™re not sure how many people have caught the disease, the fatality rate, the incubation period, how far itâ€™s spreadâ€”or how worried we should be. The imposition of travel restrictions on Wuhanâ€”and an expanding number of other citiesâ€”has surprised many. The move has left over 20 million people caught in a modern form of quarantine. Regardless of whether it succeeds in controlling the outbreak, the widespread lockdown will inevitably have a psychological effect. Not surprisingly, the UK media are already reporting the emotional impact of both the outbreak and the response. Residents are said to be comparing the situation to â€œthe end of the world,â€ hospitals are â€œoverwhelmed,â€ and there are concerns about food shortages. â€œPanic in Wuhanâ€ is commonly reported.We must be careful of â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m313	NA	10.1136/bmj.m313	348	#163	Rubin 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Ethics, social science, economics; Infection prevention and control	10.1136/bmj.m313	King’s College London, UK 	('UK', 1)
A doubt of multiple introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy: a preliminary overview	Giovanetti, Marta; Angeletti, Silvia; Benvenuto, Domenico; Ciccozzi, Massimo	The emergence of the novel beta Coronavirus, recently renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, has raised serious concerns due to the virus rapid dissemination worldwide. Nevertheless, there is limited information about the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Italy from surveillance studies. The shortage of complete genomic sequences available impairs our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 introduction and establishment in the country. To better understand its dynamics in Italy, we analysed complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, obtained directly from clinical samples. Our phylogenetic reconstructions suggest possible multiple introduction of SARS-CoV-2. Continued genomic surveillance strategies are needed to improve monitoring and understanding of the currently SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, which might help to attenuate public health impact of infectious diseases.

The first two cases of 2019-nCoV in Italy: Where they come from?	Giovanetti, Marta; Benvenuto, Domenico; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo	A novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been identified as the causal pathogen of an ongoing epidemic, with the first cases reported in Wuhan, China, last December 2019, and has since spread to other countries worldwide, included Europe and very recently Italy. In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to better understand the transmission dynamics of the virus from its first introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23rd January 2020 and labeled as Coronavirus Italian cases. A maximum clade credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019-nCoV plus two closely related bat strains (SARS-like CoV) available in GenBank. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4. The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that 2019-2020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on 25 November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19 January 2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. Strains isolated outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of likely imported cases in Rome, Italy, and Europe, as well. In conclusion, this report suggests that further spread of 2019-nCoV epidemic was supported by human mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent further transmission. Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool for the evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action.	2020	NA	Journal of Medical Virology	92	5	518-521	WOS:000512724700001	10.1002/jmv.25699	10704	#10308	Giovanetti 2020	NA	* Epidemiological study; Epidemiology; Virology, immunology	10.1002/jmv.25699	Laboratório de Flavivírus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, BrazilSearch for more papers by this author|http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3833-2927 Unit of Medical Statistics and Molecular Epidemiology, University Campus Bio‐Medico of Rome, Rome, ItalySearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: s.angeletti@unicampus.it  http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7393-8732 Unit of Clinical Laboratory Science, University Campus Bio‐Medico of Rome, Rome, Italy Correspondence Silvia Angeletti, Unit of Clinical Laboratory Science, University Campus Bio‐Medico of Rome, Rome 00128, Italy.

Rammya Mathew: Professionalism in a time of crisis	Mathew, Rammya	In recent years doctors have been accused of lacking professionalism, and many of us have suffered with self-doubt as a result. Now, however, our NHS workforce is witnessing a global pandemic on a scale we havenâ€™t experienced before. Weâ€™ve had to plan at length, reorganise structures, and redeploy our staff to ensure that weâ€™re as prepared as we can be for the coming weeks and months. None of this has happened without effort.

Are UK doctors getting sufficient protective equipment against covid-19?	Sayburn, Anna	The BMA has warned that doctors are at risk of serious illness or even death because of a lack of proper personal protective equipment (PPE). To determine the vulnerability of healthcare workers on the front line, we look at what the latest guidelines recommend and the evidence behind the use of different grades of equipment, from surgical face masks to full PPE. Are doctors and other healthcare workers being equipped with the protection the evidence indicates they need? Guidelines from Public Health England1 recommend that healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 should â€œassess the infectious risk . . . and wear the appropriate personal protective equipment to minimise that risk.â€ Evidence indicates that aerosol transmission (where the virus is suspended in air) is not driving the pandemic, although certain procedures, such as intubation, risk creating aerosols. Instead, the virus is most commonly transmitted in droplet form, when someone sneezes and coughs possibly infecting someone nearby or when droplets fall on hard surfaces and can survive for hours. Public Health England recommends different protection for different risk levels: Guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) is similar,2 but it says that healthcare workers providing â€œdirect careâ€ to patients with covid-19 should wear a gown, where Public Health England specifies an apron, and should â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	369	NA	m1297-m1297	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1297	26487	#27655	Sayburn 2020	NA	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1297	London	('UK', 1)
Guidance needed for singlehanded GPs to deal with covid-19 pandemic	O'Dowd, Adrian	Singlehanded GPs are worried about what will happen to their practice patients if they themselves become ill with the covid-19 virus and have to self-isolate, it has emerged. The situation has been highlighted by a case of a husband and wife GP, both older than 70, who each have their own singlehanded practices in Nottingham. Doctors Noble Vinayakumar Phillips and Naomi Phillips have sought, unsuccessfully so far, to secure assurances over what will happen to their patients if they both have to self-isolate. Officials say practices should have been informed about how they can support each other, make better use of technology, and have access to â€œbuddyingâ€ arrangements for practices with major staff absences. Noble Vinayakumar Phillips of the Bilborough Surgery in Nottingham, who is 76, told The BMJ : â€œAll these years, myself and my wife were able to support each other in case of emergencies or should one of us fall ill. â€œWe were already planning to retire.

Covid-19: experts question analysis suggesting half UK population has been infected	Sayburn, Anna	Experts have criticised an unpublished modelling study released to the media on Tuesday 24 March that suggested that half the UK population might already have been infected with covid-19.1 They emphasised that even if the modelling turned out to be correct it would not change the current public health advice to reduce the spread of the virus. The study, from the Nuffield Department of Medicine at the University of Oxford, used data on the number of deaths and reported cases in the early stages of the epidemic in Italy and the UK. The researchers used mathematical modelling to estimate infection rates by fitting a â€œsusceptibleâ€”infectedâ€”recoveredâ€ model of epidemics to the numbers of deaths seen. The modelling made assumptions about the proportion of the population at risk of death or severe illness, the basic reproduction number of the virus, the period of time during which people are infected, and the time from infection to death â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1216-m1216	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1216	15881	#15280	Sayburn 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1136/bmj.m1216	London	('UK', 1)

Covid-19: how to be careful with trust and expertise on social media	Llewellyn, Sue	At times of crisis we turn to expertsâ€”but news outlets and social media must be careful about the information they share, particularly informally, writes Sue Llewellyn Three times in one day I received the same warning from different groups of friends, through various channels. It came through email, Facebook, and WhatsApp, and I also saw it circulating widely on Twitter. I replied thanking them, saying that I knew they wanted to help (we all do) but that, actually, the warning wasnâ€™t true and could even be dangerous. I felt almost unkind by pointing out that holding your breath wasnâ€™t a test for covid-19. And that drinking lots of water wouldnâ€™t help it go away. These viral warnings always start the same way. A doctor/nurse/specialist health or government workerâ€”often, apparently, a friend or relativeâ€”shares a warning or advice of some kind. This often sounds credible and sometimes may even have a kernel of truth, but it almost always provokes some emotional response in the reader.

Covid-19: ibuprofen should not be used for managing symptoms, say doctors and scientists	Day, Michael	Scientists and senior doctors have backed claims by Franceâ€™s health minister that people showing symptoms of covid-19 should use paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen, a drug they said might exacerbate the condition. The minister, Oliver Veran, tweeted on Saturday 14 March that people with suspected covid-19 should avoid anti-inflammatory drugs. â€œTaking anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, cortisone . . .) could be an aggravating factor for the infection. If you have a fever, take paracetamol,â€ he said. His comments seem to have stemmed in part from remarks attributed to an infectious diseases doctor in south west France.

Covid-19 mass testing facilities could end the epidemic rapidly	Peto, Julian	In Editorâ€™s Choice of 19 March Godlee mentions the urgent need for increased capacity to test frontline healthcare workers serologically to verify their immunity to the covid-19 virus.[1] Even more urgent is capacity for weekly viral detection in the whole UK population. This, together with intensive contact tracing, could enable the country to resume normal life immediately. The virus could only survive in those who are untested, and contact tracing would often lead to them.

Covid-19: A&amp;E visits in England fall by 25% in week after lockdown	Thornton, Jacqui	Attendances at emergency departments in England have fallen significantly since the covid-19 lockdown, sparking concern that some people may be harmed by not accessing treatment. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine said that the public should not be frightened of going to emergency departments after figures showed that they saw 89â€‰584 attendances in the week after the lockdown (March 23-29), down 25% on the 120â€‰356 seen the previous week.

Covid-19: how coronavirus will change the face of general practice forever	Thornton, Jacqui	GPs say the covid-19 pandemic will bring about lasting change in how they work, Jacqui Thornton reports At practice level, primary care has altered dramatically in the past few weeks, with staffâ€”clinical and administrativeâ€”adapting to new ways of working. At some practices, entrance doors are locked shut and prescriptions given out from a window. Red tape, appraisals, and routine work has been relaxed, and home visits hugely reduced. At the end of phone and video consultations, many patients are saying â€œthank you and good luck.â€ In one practice in Hampshire, where nearly half the reception and admin staff are off work as a precaution, senior partner Alex Fitzgerald-Barron said they are as ready as possible. â€œOn the coal face, my whole team has given 110%: working hours have gone out the window, clinicians come in or video call on their day off, our local practices have been collaborating almost daily, and, for the stuff we can control, we feel as prepared as we can be,â€ he told The BMJ . Trish Greenhalgh, professor of primary care health sciences, who co-authored an article advising GPs on remote assessment for covid-19,1 said that GPs are working flat out. â€œTheyâ€™re worried about how to manage patients and also whether the personal protection equipment (PPE) theyâ€™ve got is adequate. They are shifting to phone and video at an unprecedented pace,â€ Greenhalgh said. Itâ€™s a confusing situation; some practices are fired up, others are more anxious about what might happen in the coming weeks. For single-handed surgeries, and those that were already struggling before the outbreak, there is concern about how theyâ€™re coping in this new world. In early March, Nikita Kanani, NHS Englandâ€™s medical director for primary care, wrote to GPs recommending telephone or video triage to avoid patients coming into surgeries.2 â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1279-m1279	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1279	19034	#19418	Thornton 2020	NA	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1279	London, UK	('UK', 1)

Covid-19: doctorsâ€™ leaders warn that staff could quit and may die over lack of protective equipment	Newman, Melanie	The BMA has called the shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE) across the NHS â€œtotally unacceptableâ€ and warned the government that without proper kits some doctors treating patients with covid-19 may die. Chaand Nagpaul, the BMAâ€™s Chair of Council, has called for the government to be transparent about the level of supplies it has. The Royal College of GPs has also raised concerns about the protective kits being provided to primary care staff and has called for guidance on how and when they should be using PPE during patient consultations. Reports from BMA members suggest that, in general, supplies of PPE were not getting through to frontline NHS staff, or if they were it was in small amounts, was rationed, or was not offering enough protection In response to a call for doctorsâ€™ experiences of getting PPE, one told the BMA, â€œCoughed on by covid patients all day today.

The worldâ€™s largest refugee camp prepares for covid-19	Vince, Gaia	Nearly a million refugees live in overcrowded conditions in the camps of south Bangladesh. Gaia Vince reports on the growing fears of an imminent, catastrophic outbreak of covid-19 Bangladesh, with its 168 million inhabitants, is one of the poorest and most densely populated countries in the world. Millions live cheek by jowl in slums, where 10 or more households share a toilet. People move around the country on packed buses, and still throng to markets and mosques. Last week, for instance, tens of thousands gathered in a field to pray for an end to covid-19. On 26 March the government imposed a lockdown, including banning public transport, in a bid to combat the growing pandemic, although hundreds of workers have been crowding onto private vehicles, such as trucks, instead. Bangladesh has seen the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 rise above 39, with four known deaths. The south Asian nation responded earlier in March by banning flights, shutting down schools, and promoting hygiene and social distancing measures. With very limited testing, however, and only in the capital, Dhaka, the true number of cases is expected to be far higher, and the low income nationâ€™s capacity to treat critically ill patients is limited. And thereâ€™s one further factorâ€”the overcrowded conditions of the worldâ€™s biggest refugee camp, located in Coxâ€™s Bazar in the far south east of Bangladesh. The second poorest district in the country, Coxâ€™s Bazar is home to over 855â€‰000 Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar (former Burma), as well as visiting aid workers.1 The refugees are survivors of a massacre, carried out by Myanmarâ€™s military, of the countryâ€™s minority Muslim population.

The doctors navigating covid-19 with no internet	Changoiwala, Puja	Like many countries, India has entered a nationwide shut-in to protect its 1.3 billion citizens from coronavirus. But communications blackouts in the conflicted region of Jammu and Kashmir make lockdown doubly frightening, confusing, and dangerous, writes Puja Changoiwala After diagnosing and treating an increasing number of patients with covid-19, Abdul Raheem (not his real name), a medical professional in the north Indian state of Kashmir, is faced with another major daily challengeâ€”accessing medical literature and guidelines around the pandemic. Before the global crisis hit, the Indian government had lifted a seven month communications blackout in the regionâ€”but restricted internet access to 2G services. For Raheem, thatâ€™s meant hours each day trying to download up-to-date medical journals, load videos showing procedures such as the use of hazmat suits, and access information about clinical trials on new vaccines. Raheem spoke to The BMJ under anonymity after the Indian government threatened â€œstrict actionâ€ against doctors criticising the administrationâ€™s handling of the pandemic in the media or social media. â€œOnly recently, a hospital in Wuhan published an e-book with guidelines on how to manage patients. It took me more than half an hour to download the 22 MB file,â€ said Raheem, a resident doctor in Srinagar, the summer capital of Kashmir. â€œNew data and facts are emerging every day; our perspective about covid-19 is changing every day. With a lack of high speed internet, itâ€™s extremely difficult to remain updated.

Within weeks of the first cases, a series of papers were released detailing the epidemiology of the disease (now termed COVIDâ€19) [1-3]. By early January 2020 the virus was identified and the sequence determined. The virus (termed SARSâ€CoVâ€2) shares 88% sequence identity to two coronaviruses found in bats, batâ€SLCoVZC45 and batâ€SLâ€CoVZXC21, 79% identity with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and 50% identity with Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus [4]. From the first cohort of patients, 8 complete genomes were 99.9% identical in sequence. Given that the typical RNA coronavirus evolves at a rate of 104 nucleotide substitutions per year, this suggests a recent single source emergence in early December or late November 2019 [4]. SARSâ€CoVâ€2 is thought to be transmitted via contaminated hands, surfaces and aerosolised droplets; extensive humanâ€toâ€human transmission is evident, with clusters of infected families and medical staff [5]. The number of confirmed cases has increased rapidly, at a rate that far outstripped the rate of rise of cases of SARS in 2002/3, raising serious global health concerns. By the 21st January, COVIDâ€19 cases were widespread across mainland China, soon spreading beyond the Chinese borders.	2020	NA	European Journal of Immunology	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1002/eji.202070035	2195	#2578	Park 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Epidemiology	10.1002/eji.202070035	National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UKSearch for more papers by this author|National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UKSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: p.openshaw@imperial.ac.uk  National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK Full correspondence: Peter J.

Covid-19: Trump proposes tax cuts and improved health insurance, but millions are not covered	Tanne, Janice Hopkins	The US president, Donald Trump, has proposed eliminating the payroll tax to ease the financial pain faced by US people and businesses owing to the covid-19 outbreak. He also suggested help for the countryâ€™s cruise ship industry and airlines.1 The payroll tax, paid both by US employees and employers, provides funds for Social Security pensions, Medicare (health insurance for elderly people), and many other government programs. The tax brings in over a trillion dollars (Â£773bn; â‚¬883bn) a year and is an important part of the federal budget. New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut have joined Washington state, California, Colorado, and Rhode Island in declaring states of emergency after cases of the virus increased.

In the emergency use authorization issued on 28 March,1 the agency acknowledged that the approval was based on â€œlimited in-vitro and anecdotal clinical data.â€ The FDA action followed President Trumpâ€™s statements at a press conference last week that hydroxychloroquine showed â€œtremendous promiseâ€ for patients with covid-19, adding, â€œI think itâ€™s going to be great.â€2 Trump cited a controversial French study of 20 patients published the previous day.

But he did not call for nationwide social distancing rules, saying that states might have individual situations.1 The US had 189â€‰600 cases of covid-19 and 4000 deaths as of 10 am on 1 April, according to Johns Hopkins University.2 New York City, the hardest hit area, reported 41â€‰771 cases with 1096 deaths and about 8500 people in hospital as of 31 March.3 About half of patients in hospital are aged under 50.

Covid-19: Trump extends physical distancing to 30 April, as cases climb in New York	Tanne, Janice Hopkins	President Donald Trump has extended physical distancing guidelines for the US to 30 April, reversing his earlier call for them to end on 30 March and for the nation to â€œget back to businessâ€ by Easter (12 April). He said that that had been â€œan aspirational goal.â€ Trump said that on 31 March he would present a plan for the future approach to the epidemic in the US. Trump predicted that the peak of US deaths would occur in about two weeks and that by 1 June the nation would be well on the way to recovery. He has apparently abandoned his plan to rank the nationâ€™s 3007 counties as being at low, medium, or high risk and to permit some to reopen soon for business.

Trump said that the next week or two would be bad and there would be many deaths. The pandemic is expected to peak in the next week or two in New York.

Novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) in pregnancy: What clinical recommendations to follow?	Liang, Huan; Acharya, Ganesh	Interim guidance has been issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on managing COVID-19, which include some recommendations specific to pregnant women mostly drawn on experience from previous coronavirus outbreaks.8, 9 Chinese expert recommendations for the care of pregnant women with suspected and confirmed COVID-9 were developed and disseminated in China quite early following the outbreak in Wuhan.10 These recommendations have been dynamic, evolving as more knowledge about epidemiology, pathogenesis, disease progression and clinical course among infected pregnant patients has been gathered. Limited clinical experience in managing pregnant women with COVID-19 and their neonates has been reported from China recently based on a case series of nine pregnancies with confirmed COVID-19 treated in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and 10 neonates (nine pregnancies) delivered at five different hospitals,11, 12 although many more cases (>100) of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 have been treated and delivered in several hospitals in China according to the news releases and media reports. So far, no maternal deaths have been reported. There appears to be some risk of premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, fetal tachycardia and fetal distress when the infection occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy. However, there is no evidence suggesting transplacental transmission based on very limited data, as the analysis of amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breast milk samples available from six of the nine patients were found to be negative for SARS-COV-2. Whether virus shedding occurs vaginally is also not known.	2020	NA	Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/aogs.13836	4846	#4514	Liang 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1111/aogs.13836	Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: ganesh.acharya@ki.se  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1997-3107 Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden Women’s Health and Perinatology Research Group, UiT‐The Arctic University of Norway and University Hospital of North Norway, Tromsø, Norway Correspondence Ganesh Acharya Email: ganesh.acharya@ki.seSearch for more papers by this author|Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: ganesh.acharya@ki.se  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1997-3107 Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden Women’s Health and Perinatology Research Group, UiT‐The Arctic University of Norway and University Hospital of North Norway, Tromsø, Norway Correspondence Ganesh Acharya Email: ganesh.acharya@ki.seSearch for more papers by this author 	('Norway', 6)|('China', 2)|('Sweden', 2)

Code Blue During the COVID-19 Pandemic	Chan, Paul S.; Berg, Robert A.; Nadkarni, Vinay M.	The surging COVID-19 pandemic has raised ethical and moral dilemmas that Western nations with first-rate medical care facilities rarely confront-how to best allocate standard life-saving medical resources when escalating demand outstrips supply. Sadly, these quandaries are familiar challenges in resource-poor countries. What makes this pandemic notable is that the scope and number of reported cases have been primarily in First World nations, raising questions in some settings about the use of emergency treatments like resuscitation care for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). This perspective reviews the debate around these ethical and moral dilemmas more broadly but focuses specifically on IHCA and the response of the medical community.	2020	NA	Circulation.

DEA allows buprenorphine inductions based on telephone only	Knopf, Alison	Last week, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) said opioid treatment programs (OTPs) and Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA)?waived prescribers can treat new patients with buprenorphine based on a telephone call only. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA), enforced by the DEA, requires all new patients being treated with controlled substances to have an in-person ? or, for now, telemedicine ? physical exam. Now, however, because of the coexisting COVID-19 pandemic and opioid overdose crisis, the DEA has dropped this requirement. This follows the decision of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to allow exemptions from the OTP take-home regulations allowing stable patients to be given 14 or 28 days of methadone doses, instead of coming in more frequently (see DEA, SAMHSA relax OTP/OBOT regulations due to COVID-19, ADAW March 23, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adaw.32664).	2020	NA	Alcoholism & Drug Abuse Weekly	32	14	5-Apr	NA	10.1002/adaw.32680	31092	#30548	Knopf 2020	NA	NA	10.1002/adaw.32680	Search for more papers by this author|Search for more papers by this author 	NA

Why the immune system fails to mount an adaptive immune response to a Covid -19 infection	Ahmadpoor, P.; Rostaing, L.	Abstract The Covid-19 pandemic has already affected many thousands of people and has become the greatest health challenge worldwide [1]. The range of clinical presentations varies from asymptomatic and mild clinical symptoms to acute respiratory-distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Due to the unknown number of asymptomatic viral-shedding and pauci-symptomatic people in the community, the total number of infections is uncertain. As yet, effective treatment is unavailable. However, the results of preliminary studies and clinical trials are improving our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of Covid-19. Herein, we share our personal opinions on the immunopathogenesis of this infection.	2020	NA	Transplant International	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/tri.13611	26087	#23988	Ahmadpoor 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/tri.13611	Service de Néphrologie, CHU Carémeau Nîmes, France Labafi Nejad hospital, Shahid Beheshti medical university, Tehran, IranSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: lrostaing@chu-grenoble.fr  Service de Néphrologie, Hémodialyse, Aphérèses et Transplantation Rénale, CHU Grenoble‐Alpes, France Université Grenoble‐Alpes, France Address for corresponding author Lionel Rostaing, MD, PhD, Service de Néphrologie, Dialyse, Aphérèses et Transplantation Rénale, CHU Grenoble‐Alpes, CS 10217, 38043 Grenoble Cedex 09, France, Tel: +33 4 76 76 54 60, Fax +33 4 76 76 52 63 Email: lrostaing@chu-grenoble.frSearch for more papers by this author|Service de Néphrologie, CHU Carémeau Nîmes, France Labafi Nejad hospital, Shahid Beheshti medical university, Tehran, IranSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: lrostaing@chu-grenoble.fr  Service de Néphrologie, Hémodialyse, Aphérèses et Transplantation Rénale, CHU Grenoble‐Alpes, France Université Grenoble‐Alpes, France Address for corresponding author Lionel Rostaing, MD, PhD, Service de Néphrologie, Dialyse, Aphérèses et Transplantation Rénale, CHU Grenoble‐Alpes, CS 10217, 38043 Grenoble Cedex 09, France, Tel: +33 4 76 76 54 60, Fax +33 4 76 76 52 63 Email: lrostaing@chu-grenoble.frSearch for more papers by this author 	('France', 8)|('Iran', 2)
COVID-19 and the use of immunomodulatory and biologic agents for severe cutaneous disease: An Australia/New Zealand consensus statement	Wang, Charlie; Rademaker, Marius; Baker, Christopher; Foley, Peter	Patients on immunomodulators, including biologic agents and new small molecular inhibitors, for cutaneous disease, represent a potentially vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether patients on systemic immunomodulators are at increased risk of developing COVID-19 disease or more likely to have severe disease. As such, clinicians need to assess the benefit-to-risk ratio on a case-by-case basis. In patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 disease, all immunomodulators used for skin diseases should be immediately withheld, with the possible exception of systemic corticosteroid therapy, which needs to be weaned. In patients who develop symptoms or signs of an upper respiratory tract infection, but COVID-19 is not yet confirmed, consider dose reduction or temporarily cessation for 1-2 weeks.

Covid-19: Over 300 Italian doctors and scientists call for more testing	Paterlini, Marta	NA	2020	NA	BMJ (Clinical research ed.)	368	NA	m1274-m1274	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1274	19256	#19479	Paterlini 2020	NA	* Narrative review; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment; Ethics, social science, economics	10.1136/bmj.m1274	Stockholm	NA
On the front lines of coronavirus: the Italian response to covid-19	Paterlini, Marta	Italy has rapidly become the country hit second hardest in the world by the coronavirus pandemic. Marta Paterlini reports on the front lines of a country in total lockdown â€œPatient 1â€ can breathe on his own after more than two weeks in intensive care for severe pneumonia. The 38 year old marathon runner, admitted to hospital on 21 February 2020, is believed to be the source of local transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for covid-19) in Italy, now the country with the second highest number of deaths from the virus in the world. The resulting government imposed state of emergency lockdown, which started in northern Italy and has expanded to the whole country, will last until at least 3 April in an attempt to contain a contagion that has, at the time of writing, infected over 24â€‰747 people (including at least 2026 healthcare staff) and killed 1809. The fatality rate of 7.2 is now higher than in China (3.8).1 The outbreak is having catastrophic effects on the Italian economy, which is likely to plunge into a recession, as well as social and psychological effects on the population. Government officials, however, have decided that public health should take priority, as health authorities have raised concerns over a shortage of places in intensive care units. Massimo Galli, chief physician for infectious diseases at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan, told The BMJ , â€œWe had bad luck.

Possible therapeutic role of a highly standardized mixture of active compounds derived from cultured Lentinula edodes mycelia (AHCC) in patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus	Di Pierro, Francesco; Bertuccioli, Alexander; Cavecchia, Ilaria	The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) is currently, March 2020, affecting more than 100000 people worldwide and, according to the WHO (World Health Organization), a pandemic is shortly expected. The virus infects the lower respiratory tract and causes severe pneumonia and mortality in approximately 10% and 3-5%, respectively, of cases, mainly among the elderly and/or people affected by other diseases. AHCC is an Î±-glucan-based standardized mushroom extract that has been extensively investigated as an immunostimulant both in animals and/or in humans affected by West Nile virus, influenza virus, avian influenza virus, hepatitis C virus, papillomavirus, herpes virus, hepatitis B virus and HIV by promoting a regulated and protective immune response. Although the efficacy of AHCC has not yet been specifically evaluated with respect to SARS-CoV-2 disease, its action in promoting a protective response to a wide range of viral infections, and the current absence of effective vaccines, could support its use in the prevention of diseases provoked by human pathogenic coronavirus, including COVID-19.	2020	NA	Minerva gastroenterologica e dietologica	NA	NA	10.23736/S1121-421X.20.02697-5	NA	10.23736/S1121-421X.20.02697-5	7914	#7667	DiPierro 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.23736/S1121-421X.20.02697-5	The BMJ	NA

Covid-19: What is the evidence for cloth masks?	Mahase, Elisabeth	As the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised all Americans to wear cloth masks in public to prevent the spread of covid-19, The BMJ examines the evidence People should wear cloth face coverings in public places where social distancing measures are â€œdifficult to maintain,â€ such as supermarkets and pharmacies, the CDC advises. It said the masks can be â€œfashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost.â€ It also warned that surgical masks and N-95 respirators should not be used by the public, as these were â€œcritical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders.â€ The CDC recommends using tightly woven cotton fabric, such as quilting fabric, cotton sheets, or T shirt fabric. It provided instructions on how to make masks with or without sewing, including using a bandana and coffee filter to create a face covering.1 Very little good quality research exists on the use of cloth masks, especially in non-medical settings. One randomised controlled clinical trial of cloth masks, published in BMJ Open in 2015, compared their effectiveness with that of medical masks worn by hospital healthcare workers.2 The study, involving the industry partner 3M (which makes medical masks), reported that â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	369	NA	m1422-m1422	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1422	37738	#38717	Mahase 2020	NA	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1422	The BMJ	NA

Share a daily schedule with your children and avoid sudden changes or surprises. Short bursts of more formal learning, such as spelling or writing, followed by planned play time will help children to get through the day. Consistent behaviour expectations, boundaries, and rules also help provide structure just as they would at school. â€œA key thing to remember is that the unique atmosphere of school cannot be recreated at home. Young children, especially those in early years, spend a significant amount of time at school learning through play rather than working independently. At home, activities such as playing â€œshops,â€ cooking, or gardening cover different aspects of learning, but also provide valuable practical experiences and inspiration for other learning.

Covid-19: what do trainees need to know?	Rimmer, Abi	Sarah Hallett, chair of the BMA junior doctors committee, answers questions on how the covid-19 pandemic might affect trainees This is an unprecedented situation for the NHS and itâ€™s likely that many staff, including junior doctors, will be asked to take on roles that may be unfamiliar or that they werenâ€™t expecting. We know that this is already happening in places where the pressure is being felt. Junior doctors shouldnâ€™t be asked to do anything outside of their own competence levels; if you have concerns about where you are being redeployed, you should raise this with your educational supervisor. When working in a different role, you should be supported and always know who you can escalate to. We would also expect any diversions for junior doctors to be for as short a time as possible. Itâ€™s important, too, that once pressures ease, junior doctors can return to their training posts and trusts should do all they can to make sure this is the case. This rotation can still count towards your training; itâ€™s likely that youâ€™ll continue to develop curriculum competencies that you can enter into your portfolio. Additionally, the education bodies have published contingency plans for the annual review of competence training (ARCP)1 process this year, indicating that these will still take place, with reduced panels and an increased focus on competencies. ARCPs for junior doctors at critical points in their trainingâ€”such as those completing core training or approaching the certificate of completion of trainingâ€”will be prioritised.

Covid-19: Gilead withdraws orphan drug designation from potential treatment after criticism	Mahase, Elisabeth	The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has withdrawn orphan drug designation from a potential covid-19 treatment, after criticism that treating covid-19 as a rare disease was â€œdisingenuous.â€ Pharmaceutical company Gilead requested that the FDA withdraw the designationâ€”which was set to give the company a longer exclusivity period (seven years instead of five) and significant tax incentivesâ€”just days after it was given.1 Remdesivir, which works to inhibit viral replication, is a drug currently being investigated as a potential treatment for covid-19 through several â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1259-m1259	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1259	16608	#15922	Mahase 2020	NA	* Normative guidance; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1136/bmj.m1259	The BMJ	NA
Covid-19: what treatments are being investigated?	Mahase, Elisabeth	With no current specific treatment for covid-19, the race is on to develop or repurpose drugs to help end the epidemic. The World Health Organization has now launched the SOLIDARITY trial to investigate four potential treatments: remdesivir, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir and ritonavir; and lopinavir and ritonavir plus interferon-Î².1 The trial will not be double blind, as WHO said it needed to find a balance between gold standard research practice and speed, but it will include thousands of patients from several countries. These are not, however, the only treatments being considered for covid-19. Here is a breakdown of the drugs that have been suggested so far. This is the drug that US president Donald Trump has declared â€œvery powerfulâ€ with â€œvery, very encouraging early results.â€ After a request from the US government, pharmaceutical company Teva has agreed to donate more than six million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tabletsâ€”a less toxic metabolite of chloroquineâ€”to hospitals across the country.2 Chloroquine is approved to treat malaria and rheumatoid arthritis. While it has previously been tested in vitro against a number of viruses, including SARS, and found to inhibit growth, no benefit has been seen in animal models.3 In a limited way, the drug has been tested against SARS-CoV-2â€”the cause of covid-19â€”and has reportedly been found â€œhighly effective,â€ although the evidence is still limited, with much of the data unpublished.45 Andrew Preston, reader in microbial pathogenesis at the University of Bath, said that while the early results are â€œpromisingâ€ they have â€œyet to be fully scrutinised, and, of course, it is essential to conduct â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1252-m1252	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1252	16616	#15921	Mahase 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment	10.1136/bmj.m1252	The BMJ	NA
How can I cope with redeployment?	Rimmer, Abi	During the covid-19 pandemic trainees may be asked to work in unfamiliar environments. Abi Rimmer asks experts how doctors can deal with the change Max Denning, core surgical trainee, says, â€œYou know more than you realise. As we face the realities of covid-19, extraordinary measures are needed to meet the demand on our health system. To meet this challenge, among other measures, trainees are likely to be redeployed to frontline specialties. While every trainee will feel some degree of anxiety; the experience of, and feelings about, being redeployed will vary with specialty and seniority. For junior trainees, rotating into different specialties is the norm. For senior trainees, rotations are less frequent and become increasingly specialised. Even the most sub-specialised doctors can contribute to the general medical care of patients with covid-19. All trainees develop transferable skills over time; how to manage an acute take, work as a team, escalate, refer appropriately, and most importantly how to care for unwell patients. â€œWhile it may seem isolating and daunting to work outside of â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1228-m1228	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1228	19032	#19749	Rimmer 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Ethics, social science, economics	10.1136/bmj.m1228	The BMJ	NA

Covid-19: What is the UKâ€™s testing strategy?	Iacobucci, Gareth	The NHS is using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to determine which people currently have covid-19. This involves extracting RNA from a nose or throat swab sample through laboratory analysis. It has a high level of accuracy, and results take around a day to come through. But once a person has recovered the test can no longer tell if they have been infected. The other type of test, which Public Health England (PHE) says could be available to UK residents to use at home â€œwithin days,â€ subject to testing, detects antibodies in the blood. This test is designed to detect whether someone previously had the virus. Blood or plasma samples are inserted into a small plastic cassette-shaped device, and results are typically ready within 10 minutes. Aside from the speed of obtaining results, the UKâ€™s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said that antibody tests had the advantage of being able to detect infection in people without symptoms. But the tests are less sensitive and specific than PCR tests, so can produce more false positives and false negatives. Patients in hospital intensive care units with suspected covid-19 have been first priority, followed by people with severe respiratory illness â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	368	NA	m1222-m1222	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1222	16620	#15928	Iacobucci 2020	NA	* Opinion piece; Epidemiology	10.1136/bmj.m1222	The BMJ	NA

The advice is among a raft of recommendations included in three new rapid guidelines from NICE advising doctors on caring for people with suspected or confirmed covid-19. The guidelines, published on 21 March, cover critical care, delivery of systemic anticancer treatments, and dialysis service delivery.

Covid-19: medical students to be employed by NHS as part of epidemic response	Mahase, Elisabeth	Medical students could soon be employed in various roles in the NHS, depending on their skill set, to help with the response to covid-19, as part of schemes being developed by NHS trusts and medical schools. The students would work in roles suited to their experience, from administration to physician assistants. Final year students who have passed their final exams and would like to help could even have their GMC registration brought forward, so that they could start as foundation year trainees earlier than usual. However, this option is still under consideration. The development of these roles comes after UK medical schools were urged to fast track final year students into the workforce in the wake of severe disruptions to teaching programmes caused by the covid-19 outbreak.1 Speaking to The BMJ , Kiran Patel, medical director of University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, said that he was â€œalmost brought to tearsâ€ by the number of medical students who had contacted him asking how they could help.

Epidemiological analysis of COVID-19 and practical experience from China	Ye, Qing; Wang, Bili; Mao, Jianhua; Fu, Junfen; Shang, Shiqiang; Shu, Qiang; Zhang, Ting	ABSTRACT The rapid spread of the epidemic has aroused widespread concern in the international community. SARS-COV-2 originated from Wuhan's Huanan wholesale seafood market, with bats as the likely original hosts and pangolins as potential intermediate hosts. The current source of the disease is mainly patients infected with SARS-COV-2. Patients in the incubation period may also become sources of infection. The virus is mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets and contact, and the population is generally susceptible. The epidemic has progressed through the local outbreak stage and community transmission stage due to exposure at Wuhan's Huanan wholesale seafood market and is now in the stage of large-scale transmission due to the spread of the epidemic. The basic productive number (R0) at the beginning of the epidemic was 2.2, with an average incubation period of 5.2 days. The proportion of critically ill patients was 23.4%, the mortality rate was lower than those of SARS and MERS, and 96.5% of deaths occurred in Hubei Province, where the outbreak occurred first. Among them, elderly men with underlying diseases had a higher mortality rate. Chinese medical staff have summarized a set of effective strategies and methods in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease that are worthy of reference for their international counterparts. With powerful government intervention and the efforts of Chinese medical staff, China's outbreak has gradually improved. This article is protected by copyright.

Infection control in non-clinical areas during COVID-19 pandemic	Ling, L.; Wong, W. T.; Wan, W. T. P.; Choi, G.; Joynt, G. M.	Abstract Large numbers of healthcare workers have acquired coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the workplace [1]. SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmissible as each person with COVID-19 infects approximately 2.2 close contacts, and asymptomatic transmission has been reported [2,3]. SARS-CoV-2 survives in aerosols and on surfaces from hours to days, respectively [4]. Therefore, we believe non-clinical areas are potentially high-risk for transmission between healthcare workers, and often neglected by infection prevention and control protocols. To alert others to this risk and how it may be reduced, we describe our non-clinical workplace infection prevention and control measures that have been modified from those originally developed during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic [5].	2020	NA	Anaesthesia	n/a	n/a	NA	NA	10.1111/anae.15075	45168	#42162	Ling 2020	NA	NA	10.1111/anae.15075	The Chinese University of Hong Kong, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|The Chinese University of Hong Kong, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|The Chinese University of Hong Kong, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|The Chinese University of Hong Kong, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|E-mail address: gavinmjoynt@cuhk.edu.hk  The Chinese University of Hong Kong, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|The Chinese University of Hong Kong, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|The Chinese University of Hong Kong, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|The Chinese University of Hong Kong, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|The Chinese University of Hong Kong, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author|E-mail address: gavinmjoynt@cuhk.edu.hk  The Chinese University of Hong Kong, ChinaSearch for more papers by this author 	('China', 10)|('uhk ', 2)
Learning from the Past: Possible Urgent Prevention and Treatment Options for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections Caused by 2019-nCoV	Morse, J. S.; Lalonde, T.; Xu, S.; Liu, W. R.	With the current trajectory of the 2019-nCoV outbreak unknown, public health and medicinal measures will both be needed to contain spreading of the virus and to optimize patient outcomes. Although little is known about the virus, an examination of the genome sequence shows strong homology with its better-studied cousin, SARS-CoV. The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and macrocyclic peptides. Other key drug targets, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), share a strikingly high (>95 %) homology to SARS-CoV. Herein, we suggest four potential drug candidates (an ACE2-based peptide, remdesivir, 3CLpro-1 and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor) that could be used to treat patients suffering with the 2019-nCoV. We also summarize previous efforts into drugging these targets and hope to help in the development of broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral agents for future epidemics.	2020	NA	ChemBioChem	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1002/cbic.202000047	3750	#3842	Morse 2020	NA	* Opinion piece	10.1002/cbic.202000047	The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843 USA These authors contributed equally to this workSearch for more papers by this author|The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843 USA These authors contributed equally to this workSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: shiqing.xu@tamu.edu  The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843 USASearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: wliu@chem.tamu.edu  http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7078-6534 The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843 USASearch for more papers by this author|The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843 USA These authors contributed equally to this workSearch for more papers by this author|The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843 USA These authors contributed equally to this workSearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: shiqing.xu@tamu.edu  The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843 USASearch for more papers by this author|Corresponding Author  E-mail address: wliu@chem.tamu.edu  http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7078-6534 The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843 USASearch for more papers by this author 	('USA', 8)

An exclusive 42 amino acid signature in pp1ab protein provides insights into the evolutive history of the 2019 novel human-pathogenic coronavirus (SARS-CoV2)	CÃ¡rdenas-Conejo, Yair; LiÃ±an-Rico, AndrÃ³meda; GarcÃ­a-RodrÃ­guez, Daniel Alejandro; Centeno-Leija, Sara; Serrano-Posada, Hugo	The city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China, was the origin of a severe pneumonia outbreak in December 2019, attributed to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2), causing a total of 2761 deaths and 81109 cases (February 25, 2020). SARS-CoV2 belongs to genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. The polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) remains unstudied thoroughly since it is similar to other sarbecoviruses. In this short communication, we performed phylogenetic-structural sequence analysis of pp1ab protein of SARS-CoV2. The analysis showed that the viral pp1ab has not changed in most isolates throughout the outbreak time, but interestingly a deletion of 8 aa in the virulence factor non-structural protein 1 was found in a virus isolated from a Japanese patient that did not display critical symptoms. While comparing pp1ab protein with other betacoronaviruses, we found a 42 amino acid signature that is only present in SARS-CoV2 (AS-SCoV2). Members from clade 2 of sarbecoviruses have traces of this signature. The AS-SCoV2 located in the acidic-domain of papain-like protein of SARS-CoV2 and bat-SL-RatG13 guided us to suggest that the novel 2019 coronavirus probably emerged by genetic drift from bat-SL-CoV-RaTG13. The implication of this amino acid signature in papain-like protein structure arrangement and function is something worth to be explored. This article is protected by copyright.

Dentists' awareness, perception, and attitude regarding COVID-19 and infection control: A cross-sectional study among Jordanian dentists	Khader, Yousef; Al Nsour, Mohannad; Al-Batayneh, Ola Barakat; Saadeh, Rami; Bashier, Haitham; Alfaqih, Mahmoud; Al-Azzam, Sayer; AlShurman, Bara' Abdallah	BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of prevention guidelines and recommendations on infection control, many dental practices lack the minimum requirements of infection control. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the level of awareness, perception, and attitude regarding COVID-19 and infection control among Jordanian dentists. METHODS: The study population consisted of dentists who work in private clinics, hospitals, and health centers in Jordan. An online questionnaire was sent to a sample of Jordanian dentists in March 2020. The questionnaire comprised a series of questions about dentists' demographic characteristics, their awareness of incubation period, the symptoms of the disease, mode of transmission of the COVID-19, and infection control measures for preventing COVID-19, and their attitude toward treating patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: This study included a total of 368 dentists aged from 22 to 73 year with a mean (SD) of 32.9 (10.6) year. A total of 112 (30.4%) had completed a master or residency program in dentistry, 195 (53.0%) had received training in infection control in dentistry, and 28 (7.6%) had attended training or received lectures regarding COVID-19. A total of 133 (36.1%) dentists reported that the incubation period is 1-14 days. The majority of dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways of how to identify patients at risk of having COVID-19, were able to correctly report known modes of transmission and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics. A total of 275 (74.7%) believed that it is necessary to ask patients to sit far from each other, wear masks while in the waiting room, and wash hands before getting in the dental chair to decrease disease transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Jordanian dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms, mode of transmission, infection control and measures in dental clinic. However, dentists had limited comprehension of the extra precautionary measures that protect the dental staff and other patients from COVID-19. National and international guidelines should be sent by the regional and national dental associations to all registered dentists during crisis, including this COVID -19 pandemic, to make sure that dentists are well informed and aware of the best practices and recommended disease management approaches.

Preventive Behaviors Conveyed on YouTube to Mitigate Transmission of COVID-19: Cross-Sectional Study	Basch, Corey H.; Hillyer, Grace C.; Meleo-Erwin, Zoe C.; Jaime, Christie; Mohlman, Jan; Basch, Charles E.	BACKGROUND: Accurate information and guidance about personal behaviors that can reduce exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are among the most important elements in mitigating the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With over 2 billion users, YouTube is a media channel that millions turn to when seeking information. OBJECTIVE: At the time of this study, there were no published studies investigating the content of YouTube videos related to COVID-19. This study aims to address this gap in the current knowledge. METHODS: The 100 most widely viewed YouTube videos uploaded throughout the month of January 2020 were reviewed and the content covered was described. Collectively, these videos were viewed over 125 million times. RESULTS: Fewer than one-third of the videos covered any of the seven key prevention behaviors listed on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. CONCLUSIONS: These results represent an important missed opportunity for disease prevention.	2020	NA	JMIR public health and surveillance	6	2	e18807-e18807	NA	10.2196/18807	30673	#31011	Basch 2020	NA	NA	10.2196/18807	University Hall	NA

Virological assessment of hospitalized patients with COVID-2019	WÃ¶lfel, Roman; Corman, Victor M.; Guggemos, Wolfgang; Seilmaier, Michael; Zange, Sabine; MÃ¼ller, Marcel A.; Niemeyer, Daniela; Jones, Terry C.; Vollmar, Patrick; Rothe, Camilla; Hoelscher, Michael; Bleicker, Tobias; BrÃ¼nink, Sebastian; Schneider, Julia; Ehmann, Rosina; Zwirglmaier, Katrin; Drosten, Christian; Wendtner, Clemens	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory tract infection that emerged in late 20191,2. Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8% cases with severe, and 6.1% with critical courses3. This severe presentation corresponds to the usage of a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4. By causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor tropism is thought to have determined pathogenicity, but also aided the control, of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 20035. However, there are reports of COVID-19 cases with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission6â€“8. There is an urgent need for information on body site-specific virus replication, immunity, and infectivity. Here we provide a detailed virological analysis of nine cases, providing proof of active virus replication in upper respiratory tract tissues. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms (peak at 7.11 Ã— 108 RNA copies per throat swab, day 4). Infectious virus was readily isolated from throat- and lung-derived samples, but not from stool samples, in spite of high virus RNA concentration. Blood and urine never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by viral replicative RNA intermediates in throat samples. Sequence-distinct virus populations were consistently detected in throat and lung samples from the same patient, proving independent replication. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50% of patients (14 days in all), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness. Active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract puts the prospects of COVID-19 containment in perspective.	2020	NA	Nature	NA	NA	NA	NA	10.1038/s41586-020-2196-x	25880	#23868	WÃ¶lfel 2020	NA	NA	10.1038/s41586-020-2196-x	University Hospital LMU Munich, Munich, Germany	('Germany', 1)

Covid-19: Can Franceâ€™s ethical support units help doctors make challenging decisions?	Arie, Sophie	France has set up â€œethical support unitsâ€ to help doctors make difficult choices about which patients with covid-19 to treat in intensive care. Sophie Arie reports With more than 2600 deaths and 40â€‰000 cases of covid-19 recorded in France, hospitals in the Ile de France region surrounding Paris have been preparing for a tipping point in the week beginning Monday 30 March, when their 2000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds are expected to be full. â€œWe will have to make terrible choices about who will or will not be admitted to ICUs,â€ Bertrand Guidet, head of the ICU at Saint Antoine Hospital in Paris, told The BMJ . â€œWe have never had to make such difficult decisions.â€ Doctors will have to make far more decisions than usual on whether to treat patients or withdraw treatment from those who are too ill to benefit. But in addition, because of shortages of beds or ventilators, doctors will increasingly have to choose one patient over another when both could benefit from treatment. Each of Franceâ€™s 13 regions will now have an â€œethical â€¦	2020	NA	BMJ	369	NA	m1291-m1291	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1291	26483	#27681	Arie 2020	NA	NA	10.1136/bmj.m1291	University hospitals already have systems in place to support doctors who constantly make decisions.

COVID- 19 misinformation on the internet: The other epidemy	Cuan-Baltazar, Jose Yunam; Munoz-Perez, Maria Jose; Robledo-Vega, Carolina; Perez-Zepeda, Maria Fernanda; Soto-Vega, Elena	BACKGROUND: The internet has become an important source of health information for users worldwide. The novel Coronavirus caused a pandemic search for information with broad dissemination of false or misleading health information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality and readability of online information about Wuhan Coronavirus (actually COVID-19), which was a trending topic in the net, using validated instruments and relate the quality of information to its readability. METHODS: The search was based on the term Wuhan Coronavirus on the Google website (6 February 2020). At the search time, the terms "COVID-19" or "SARS-CoV-2" did not exist yet. Critical analysis was performed on the first 110 hits using HON code, JAMA benchmark, DISCERN instrument, and Google rank. RESULTS: The Google search returned 309,000,000 hits. The first 110 websites were critically analyzed, and only 1.81% of the websites had the HON code seal. The JAMA benchmark showed that 39% of websites did not have any of the categories required by this tool and only 10% of the websites had the 4 quality criteria required by JAMA. The DISCERN score showed that 70% of the websites were evaluated as low score and none one was rated as high score. CONCLUSIONS: Non-health personnel and the scientific community need to be aware of the quality of the information they read and produce respectively. The Wuhan Coronavirus health crisis misinformation was produced by the media and the misinformation the users obtain from the net. The use of the internet has a risk to public health and in cases like this; the governments should be developing strategies to regulate health information in the internet without censuring the population. By February 6, no quality information was available in the internet about COVID-19.	2020	NA	JMIR Public Health Surveill	NA	NA	NA	32250960	10.2196/18444	41579	#40248	Cuan-Baltazar 2020	NA	NA	10.2196/18444	University|University or medical center|University or medical center and nonprofit organization	NA
